  "S: Jeremy reports a lower back injury from moving boxes about four months ago. He initially experienced a sensation of inability to support his upper body weight and tingling in the right toes, which subsided after an hour. Current symptoms include sharp pain in the lower back with certain movements or sleep positions and a sensation of weakness when carrying heavy objects. He has tried physical therapy at his gym, Tylenol, ibuprofen, heat, and ice without significant relief. Jeremy is concerned due to the duration of his symptoms. He had a total knee replacement on his right knee about two years ago, which is well-healed. He denies any changes in bowel or bladder function, fever, or chills.\n\nO: Vital signs: Temperature normal, BP 117/56, HR 68, SpO2 95% on room air. Neck exam shows C5-C6 bony protuberance without pain. Lumbar spine exam reveals decreased flexion/extension, paraspinal muscle spasm, and positive straight leg raise. Lower extremity strength is equal bilaterally. Lumbar spine X-ray shows no acute bony abnormalities.\n\nA: Acute disk herniation suspected based on clinical history and symptoms. Possible musculoskeletal strain or arthritis.\n\nP: Order a lumbar spine MRI to assess soft tissue details. Refer for physical therapy through the health system. Prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily. Consider an epidural steroid injection if MRI confirms a herniated disk and symptoms persist.",
  "S: The patient, with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, chronic heart failure, and chronic renal failure, reported new symptoms of tarry stools. The patient denies any family history of cancer.\n\nO: The patient underwent a colonoscopy revealing a 30 \u00d7 30 mm type 2 tumor in the transverse colon, identified as a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Laboratory tests showed normal CEA (3.1 ng/ml) and CA19-9 (3.4 U/ml) levels. A CT scan indicated wall thickening at the tumor site, diagnosed as T2N0M0, stage I, with no evidence of metastasis. Post-colectomy examination of the specimen indicated a 10-mm ulcer with a central polypoid lesion, but no type 2 tumor was found. Histology showed nonspecific granulation tissue and fibrillization under the mucous membrane.\n\nA: The initial assessment was a T2N0M0 stage I lesion in the transverse colon, suspected to invade the muscularis propria. After resection, no type 2 tumor was detected, suggesting a possible false alarm. \n\nP: The plan included monitoring the patient closely for any changes or new symptoms. The patient is advised not to take any alternative medications, supplements, or immunotherapy. Follow-up is necessary to observe any changes in the patient's condition.",
  "S: The patient is a 39-year-old man with a history of heroin and amphetamine abuse. He experienced hallucinations and injected 0.5 mL of 24% paraquat into his right cephalic vein approximately 4 hours before arriving at the emergency department. He reported mild dyspnea, abdominal pain, and right wrist pain over the injection site. He also experienced tenderness in the epigastric area. During hospitalization, he developed acute kidney injury on the fourth day, with serum creatinine rising from 0.96 to 4.57 mg/dL and decreased urine output from >2000 to 900 mL daily. He also reported intermittent postprandial abdominal pain and constipation since the paraquat poisoning.\n\nO: The patient's vital signs included a pulse rate of 63 beats/min, respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min, blood pressure of 112/69 mm Hg, and mild hypothermia with a body temperature of 35.8\u00b0C. There was an erythematous injection site on the right wrist. Laboratory tests showed a positive urine paraquat test (4+) and initial plasma paraquat concentration of 0.51 \u03bcg/mL. The chest radiograph showed normal findings. A follow-up urine paraquat test was negative. Serum creatinine rose to 4.57 mg/dL with decreased urine output.\n\nA: The patient was diagnosed with paraquat poisoning, which initially involved normal chest radiograph findings but led to acute kidney injury. The improvement in urine paraquat levels and absence of dyspnea indicated stable management of the poisoning.\n\nP: The patient received charcoal hemoperfusion therapy to remove paraquat and was admitted to the ICU for monitoring. The plan included fluid supplementation to manage the acute kidney injury and maintaining urine output, with caution regarding nephrotoxic medications. Follow-up was advised for his acute kidney injury and gastrointestinal symptoms, and stable condition allowed for discharge 13 days after admission. Continuing care with healthcare providers was recommended.",
  "S: The patient has a medical history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and smoking. They were initially asymptomatic when a pancreatic cyst was incidentally discovered during a lung cancer screening CT. The patient reports no symptoms related to the pancreatic cyst.\n\nO: The initial CT showed a 23 x 18 mm fluid density lesion in the distal pancreatic body with no pancreatic ductal dilation. EUS-FNA revealed an anechoic and septated cyst, with an aspirate showing an amylase level of 1532 and a CEA level of less than 200. Cytology indicated a moderately cellular aspirate with no malignant cells, suggesting a pseudocyst or benign cyst. A follow-up CT showed the cyst persisted with unchanged size. A repeat EUS-FNA using nCLE showed thick cord-like and dark nest-like structures in the cyst, without dark rings, vasculature network, or papillary projections. These findings were indicative of a cystic neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas.\n\nA: The findings from nCLE and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of a cystic neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas.\n\nP: The patient was referred for surgical evaluation to determine the appropriate treatment for the cystic neuroendocrine tumor, with surgery being recommended to prevent potential complications.",
  "S: The patient has a past history of intestinal obstruction due to sigmoid volvulus, for which they underwent laparotomy and detwisting sigmoidopexy, followed by elective sigmoidectomy. Currently, the patient reports experiencing abdominal distension, constipation, and vomiting that started about 2 months ago, accompanied by severe abdominal pain lasting one day. The patient also mentions recurrent constipation and has been using over-the-counter or traditional medications without seeking prior medical advice. There is no significant family, drug, or social history reported.\n\nO: The patient appeared ill with a pulse rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 cycles per minute, and a temperature of 38.8\u00b0C. The abdomen was grossly distended with full flanks, a midline scar, visible dilated bowel loop, peristalsis, and generalized tenderness; no bowel sounds were detected. A digital rectal examination showed a 3rd degree pile and an empty rectum. Blood tests revealed Hb of 13 g/dl, WBCs of 14 \u00d7 10^9/L, PLT count of 305 \u00d7 10^9/L, and blood glucose of 193 mg/dl, with normal renal profile and serum electrolytes. An abdominal X-ray indicated a typically dilated omega-shaped colon.\n\nA: The clinical assessment suggests a strangulated bowel obstruction, with adhesive type being the top differential diagnosis. Recurrent or other site volvulus is considered a remote possibility.\n\nP: The plan involves optimizing the patient\u2019s general condition with NG tube suction and intravenous fluids resuscitation. Further treatment will follow based on close monitoring of the patient\u2019s condition. Regular follow-ups are advised, and the patient should report any changes in symptoms or condition.",
  "S: The patient reported noticing a lump in the left breast, which has been bothering her.

MRI showed several smaller rim-enhancing lesions with characteristics suggesting possible metastatic disease. An MR also detected a left lower lobe lung mass with associated atelectasis. A 14G core biopsy of the left breast mass indicated poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, likely of lung origin, and fine-needle aspiration of left axillary nodes was positive for malignant cells. A staging CT scan confirmed a mass in the apical segment of the left lower lobe and widespread sclerotic bony metastasis.\n\nA: Diagnosed with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, likely of lung origin, with metastatic involvement of the breast, lymph nodes, lung, and axial skeleton. Development of solitary brain metastasis noted 13 months after initial diagnosis.\n\nP: The patient has been treated with chemotherapy. Disease progression led to the development of a solitary brain metastasis, but 7 years post-diagnosis, the disease remains well-controlled, allowing the patient to maintain a good quality of life.",
  "S: The patient is a 5-year-old female presenting with a mass and pain on her scalp for 8 days, accompanied by fever for the past 2 days with a peak temperature of 39 \u00b0C. The mass was surgically incised and drained at a local hospital, and she received cefuroxime and metronidazole intravenously without improvement. The skin lesions on her scalp have worsened, forming an ulcer surface with increased purulent secretion. She resides in the countryside and has been around dogs, but there is no specific trauma or incident recalled.\n\nO: Examination reveals several ulcers fused into a large 10 by 12 cm tender erythematous boggy swelling on the scalp, with hair loss and yellowish-brown to hemorrhagic crusts. Removal of crusts shows a seropurulent discharge with stench and tenderness. Blood test shows a WBC count of 12.41 \u00d7 10^9/L, neutrophils at 8.90 \u00d7 10^9/L (71.70%), and ESR at 43 mm/h. Bacterial culture from the lesion grows Staphylococcus aureus. Hair and ulcer samples reveal fungi with septate hyphae inside the hair root.\n\nA: The patient presents with a mixed infection of bacterial and fungal origins, specifically involving Staphylococcus aureus and fungi with septate hyphae.\n\nP: Treat with a combination of antibiotics for the bacterial infection and antifungal medications for the fungal infection. Monitor progress closely and adjust treatment as needed.",
  "S: The patient reported discovering a new mass in the left breast during the postpartum period. She has no family history of breast or ovarian cancer and is not breastfeeding. She has a history of an excisional biopsy for a benign right breast mass seven years ago.\n\nO: The clinical breast exam found a 3.6 cm mass at the 12 o'clock position of the left breast, 4 cm from the nipple. Axillary examination was normal. Ultrasound showed a heterogenous 3.48 cm mass in the left breast. Needle biopsy suggested benign breast tissue with focal secretary changes and chronic inflammation, discordant with imaging. Excisional biopsy revealed a 3.2 cm malignant phyllodes tumor extending to margins, requiring re-excision. Final pathology identified a 1.5 cm area of DCIS at the lateral margin, ER+ (90%) and PR-, with a positive margin. A diagnostic mammogram showed suspicious calcifications. The final pathology after re-excision and biopsy revealed an additional 7 mm of intermediate grade DCIS, a negative final margin, and no evidence of malignant phyllodes tumor.\n\nA: The patient has been diagnosed with a malignant phyllodes tumor successfully re-excised and intermediate grade DCIS. The DCIS is ER+ (90%) and PR- with an initial positive margin, managed with further re-excision.\n\nP: The patient underwent adjuvant radiation therapy and has been prescribed tamoxifen. Follow-up imaging and clinical exams are stable. Patient should continue regular monitoring and follow-up appointments to assess for any recurrence or new developments.",
  "S: The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of ischaemic heart disease and dyslipidemia. He had a previously identified abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) that was incidentally found. A CT angiography showed an infrarenal AAA measuring 6.3 cm \u00d7 7.0 cm \u00d7 20.0 cm, extending to the right common iliac artery, with scattered wall calcifications. The patient underwent a successful repair of the AAA via an endovascular approach using a bifurcated endovascular stent graft. Approximately 3 months post-procedure, he experienced a fever of about 39\u00b0C, chills, loss of appetite, and back pain. There were no reports of vomiting or diarrhea.\n\nO: The CT angiography showed an infrarenal AAA with scattered wall calcifications extending to the right common iliac artery. Post-procedure blood work showed a total white cell count of 15 \u00d7 10^9/l with predominant neutrophilia. A repeat CT showed air surrounding the endovascular graft, with associated inflammatory changes and aortic wall thickening, and the air extended to the proximal common iliac artery. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nA: The patient developed an infection surrounding the endovascular graft with sepsis due to Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nP: Medical therapy and appropriate antibiotics were initiated to treat the infection, with a plan for surgical intervention once the patient stabilized. Despite these efforts, the patient succumbed to sepsis after 1 week of medical therapy. Family support and communication were maintained throughout the process.",
  "S: The patient is experiencing slowly progressive memory issues, particularly with remembering new names and appointments. He has a history of prostate cancer diagnosed 10 years ago with hepatic metastases detected a few months prior to this presentation. He also has a history of asthma and migraines, asymptomatic for over 20 years. The patient is currently being treated with docetaxel for prostate cancer.\n\nO: The neurological examination showed a mild tandem gait imbalance. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) score was 22 out of 30, indicating mild cognitive impairment with deficits in language, abstraction, verbal memory, and orientation. Serum analysis detected ARHGAP26 antibodies with a CBA titer of 1:3,200. Immunohistochemistry showed cerebellar staining and rat hippocampal staining patterns typical of ARHGAP26.\n\nA: The patient presents with mild cognitive impairment likely related to paraneoplastic syndrome associated with prostate cancer metastases. The presence of ARHGAP26 antibodies supports this.\n\nP: The patient did not receive immunosuppressive therapy during the period of observation. Management continued for metastatic prostate cancer until his passing. Follow-up included cognitive assessments and observation of antibody titers, which increased over time. No additional interventions for cognitive impairment discussed.",
  "S: The patient reported feeling \"a little off\" but did not expect anything serious. They underwent a routine health examination that revealed a hepatic disorder. Concerns arose regarding the findings of blood tests and imaging studies.\n\nO: The patient's lab results showed elevated aspartate aminotransferase at 48 U/L (normal range: 13 to 33 U/L) and alanine phosphatase at 66 U/L (normal range: 8.0 to 42 U/L). The alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 were within normal ranges. An abdominal ultrasonography revealed an 8 \u00d7 7-mm solid mass and several stones in the gallbladder. An enhanced CT scan showed irregular wall thickening at the gallbladder fundus and the T2-weighted MRI depicted a high-intensity nodule at the gallbladder fundus. During surgery, a 10-mm tumor at the gallbladder fundus and color change on the adjacent liver bed floor were observed. The resected specimen had a 15 \u00d7 10-mm milky yellow mass with papillary lesions.\n\nA: Based on the imaging findings and histopathology, the lesion was diagnosed as suspicious of malignancy with papillary tumors and cystic formations. Mucin secretion was noted in the tumors.\n\nP: The plan includes a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and liver bed resection to remove the tumor and affected tissue. There will be close monitoring and regular follow-up appointments to check for recurrence. The patient is advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle and attend all scheduled follow-ups.",
  "S: The patient reported a history of squamous cell carcinoma in the left maxillary gingiva diagnosed a couple of years ago. They underwent a partial maxillectomy to remove the tumor. Two years post-surgery, two dental implants were placed in the anterior maxillary region, and one zygomatic implant was placed into the right zygomatic bone. Six months later, during a second-stage surgery, one anterior dental implant was removed due to loss of osseointegration. The patient reports that the remaining implants and prosthesis have been stable for 1 year and 6 months since functional loading, with no issues reported.\n\nO: No information provided.\n\nA: History of squamous cell carcinoma in the left maxillary gingiva with subsequent partial maxillectomy.

  "S: The patient reports mild chronic diarrhea that worsens when taking metformin. A positive fecal occult blood test led to the referral. The patient has a history of ischemic heart disease and is currently taking clopidogrel. There was an interruption in a past sigmoidoscopy due to pain from a spastic diverticular sigmoid.\n\nO: The procedure showed a complete cutoff at the sigmoid and descending colonic junction. A CT scan revealed a contrast-enhancing \"scar-like\" structure in the colon wall, with adherences to the retroperitoneum and left iliac fossa. There was no obstruction, but a functional stenosis was detected. An ultrasound showed a thickening of the muscle layer and hyperechoic scar tissue at the same junction.\n\nA: The findings suggest a functional stenosis due to a scar-like structure in the sigmoid colon, with no signs of obstruction or fecal stasis. The muscle layer thickening supports the presence of scar tissue.\n\nP: The plan includes close monitoring and discussing potential treatment options. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled.",
  "S: The patient reports an urge to move their legs accompanied by an indescribable sensation, which worsens during rest, particularly before sleep. This discomfort impacts their ability to fall asleep, and despite 10 hours of sleep, they feel uncomfortable and tired upon waking. The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia and ischemic heart disease. Moving the legs alleviates the symptoms.\n\nO: The patient has a body mass index of 23.5 kg/m\u00b2 and a serum ferritin level of 69 ng/mL, both within normal ranges. A full-night PSG recording indicated that periodic leg movement bursts are causing sleep initiation and maintenance issues. During the study, 4W-acuinjections with pentazocine were administered in both legs, resulting in relief of discomfort and more restorative sleep.\n\nA: The patient is likely experiencing Restless Leg Syndrome with Periodic Leg Movement bursts causing sleep disruption during drowsiness, but not during full wakefulness.\n\nP: Continue with hypnotic medication and monitor sleep patterns. If discomfort persists or worsens, the patient should return for a follow-up assessment.",
  "S: The patient, John Doe, reports experiencing a severe headache over the past four days, accompanied by a sensation of feeling hot and suspecting a fever, though he hasn't measured his temperature. The headache began before the fever. He has taken Paracetamol and Ibuprofen, which have not provided relief. He hasn't experienced photophobia, neck pain, nausea, vomiting, cough, cold symptoms, earaches, or muscle weakness, but reports general muscle aching. He denies any pins and needles sensations. No known medical or surgical history, no allergies, and no regular medications. He traveled to Thailand recently, had mosquito bites, and notes a friend also feeling unwell. He feels cold but not shivering. The patient describes a red and itchy rash covering his body, which blanches under pressure.\n\nO: No objective findings provided, as the patient was not physically examined during the conversation.\n\nA: The clinician suspects a viral illness potentially related to recent travel and mosquito bites. Conditions considered include viral fever and dengue fever, but the absence of symptoms like non-blanching rash or bleeding points away from dengue. Meningitis is considered unlikely due to the absence of photophobia and neck stiffness, and because the rash blanches. However, a thorough examination is needed to rule out these conditions or others.\n\nP: The doctor recommends an urgent physical examination at a hub or suggests visiting the hospital if an appointment isn't available. An exam should occur within the next few hours to potentially conduct further tests, including blood tests and a more detailed clinical assessment, to determine the cause of symptoms. Follow-up depends on exam findings and test outcomes.",
  "S: The patient reported unintentional body weight loss. They have a history of well-controlled hypertension and diabetes managed with medication.\n\nO: Laboratory tests indicated decreased hemoglobin levels at 9.1 g/dl. Tumor markers were within normal limits. A colonoscopy revealed a circumferential tumor in the sigmoid colon, identified as a RAS-mutant adenocarcinoma. A contrast-enhanced CT scan showed irregular colonic wall thickening with massive involvement of the urinary bladder and enlarged lymph nodes suggestive of metastases (LACC stage IIIC, T4bN2M0). A follow-up CT after chemotherapy showed significant tumor shrinkage. Post-operative findings from a sigmoid colectomy and partial bladder resection indicated tumor cell presence in less than one third of the lesion, consistent with a grade 1a effect. The pathological final diagnosis was ypT4b, ypN0, M0, ypStage IIC. There has been no recurrence at 16 months post-initial diagnosis.\n\nA: The patient was diagnosed with RAS-mutant adenocarcinoma in the sigmoid colon, stage IIIC, with no evidence of distant metastasis. Final diagnosis after treatment was ypStage IIC.\n\nP: Treatment included a loop transverse colostomy, 6 courses of chemotherapy with CAPOX plus bevacizumab (with 1 course omitting oxaliplatin due to neurotoxicity), a follow-up CT, a sigmoid colectomy, and partial bladder resection. Post-operatively, the patient received 8 courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine. Monitoring will continue to ensure no recurrence and to provide necessary support.",
  "S: The patient was a 47-year-old Asian male with a 17 pack-year history of smoking. He reported feeling weak and experiencing trouble breathing.\n\nO: The patient presented with metastatic disease, including a primary tumor in the left upper lobe (4.7 cm diameter), extensive thoracic lymphadenopathy, and multiple ring-enhancing brain metastases (up to 4.5 cm diameter, mostly in the right cerebral hemisphere). Pathology of the lung mass showed adenocarcinoma with an EGFR exon 20 variant. After whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), the brain lesions showed near-complete response. However, the chest CT re-evaluation revealed small, innumerable bilateral lung nodular metastases. Subsequent treatment with cisplatin and pemetrexed resulted in a partial response in the left lung primary tumor and near-complete resolution of the miliary lung metastases. Disease progression led to treatment with docetaxel, nivolumab, and erlotinib. Fifteen months later, MRI of the head showed new, numerous tiny brain metastases without significant edema.\n\nA: The patient had metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung with an EGFR exon 20 variant, indicating reduced sensitivity to EGFR-TKI. The cancer was progressive despite various treatments.\n\nP: Initial treatment included whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), followed by cisplatin and pemetrexed.

  "S: \nThe patient reports worsening back pain for a week, tingling, numbness in lower limbs, and difficulty walking. They also experience muscle weakness in lower limbs and decreased sensation on the upper back.\n\nO: \nThe physical examination shows moderate muscle weakness in the lower limbs and superficial hypesthesia below the T5 level, indicating a dorsal cord disorder. Laboratory tests and radiography show no abnormalities, but an MRI reveals a dorsally located epidural lesion between Th5-Th8 vertebrae, suggesting an epidural hematoma.\n\nA: \nThe clinical impression is a dorsally located epidural lesion likely due to an epidural hematoma. The final pathology confirms a diagnosis of nonfiltrating spinal angiolipoma.\n\nP: \nThe plan includes an emergent surgical excision of the lesion via Th5-8 laminectomy. The surgery will address the tumor resection and potential complications, such as intraoperative blood loss. Postoperatively, the patient's sensory loss, numbness, and gait disturbance are expected to improve, and follow-up examinations will monitor recovery and check for recurrence within one year.",
  "S: The patient reports experiencing unusual pain in their left carotid area for the past 24 hours, with the pain radiating to the ear. The patient expresses concern about the seriousness of the condition.\n\nO: The Colour Doppler ultrasound shows an eccentric hypoechoic thickening in the proximal bulbar internal carotid area and partially in the carotid bifurcation with a thin hyperechoic atheromatous fibrous plaque but no significant stenosis. The Contrast-enhanced ultrasound indicates a normal capillary distribution of microbubbles in the hypoechoic thickening, confirming no haematoma, and a well-demonstrated avascular fibrous plaque. The MR imaging reveals hypointense tissue around the proximal internal carotid with intense enhancement on fat-saturated contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images.\n\nA: The patient is diagnosed with Carotidynia or TIPIC syndrome, a treatable condition characterized by inflammation of the carotid artery.\n\nP: The treatment plan includes administering non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce inflammation and pain. Follow-up with a Doppler ultrasound is scheduled in 14 days to monitor the progress and regression of the condition. The patient is advised to reach out with any further concerns or questions.",
  "S: The patient has been experiencing low mood, suicidal thoughts, and suspicion of others for the past 4 weeks. The patient reports that these symptoms have worsened upon initial treatment with sertraline and olanzapine, leading to slower thought processes and epileptic seizures.\n\nO: The patient had a CSF pressure of 240 cmH2O, a leukocyte count of 10 \u00d7 10^6/L, and anti-NMDAR antibodies in CSF and serum at level 1:32. Initial EEG showed epileptic activity with sharp-slow waves in the right anterior frontotemporal region. B-ultrasound and CT of the chest and abdomen were clear of tumors. The patient developed heart and respiratory failure, visual and auditory hallucinations, delusions, aggressive behaviors, muscle stiffness, and slurred speech during treatment.\n\nA: The initial diagnosis was severe depression, but given the presence of anti-NMDAR antibodies, the assessment suggests anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The patient\u2019s psychiatric symptoms and seizures align with this diagnosis.\n\nP: The treatment plan involves intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), methylprednisolone, and prednisolone for two courses. Levetiracetam and valproic acid are prescribed for epilepsy control. Clonazepam was started for psychiatric symptom improvement, and midazolam sedation was used in ICU. The new medication, quetiapine, is being introduced to manage psychiatric symptoms with ongoing monitoring and adjustment as necessary.",
  "S: The patient has a history of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and previous treatment for prostate cancer with external beam radiation therapy. Recently, the patient reported feeling weak and tired, and noticed that the right testicle seems enlarged.\n\nO: Serum biochemistry indicated hypercalcaemia. A CT scan demonstrated a large right-sided scrotal mass with soft tissue extending through the inguinal canal to the inferior vena cava, along with bilateral lung nodules up to 14mm, considered metastatic. An ultrasound showed a heterogeneous mass replacing the right testicle with infiltration of the right epididymis and spermatic cord, demonstrating increased Doppler vascularity. Histology from an ultrasound-guided biopsy revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, germinal centre subtype.\n\nA: The differential diagnosis initially included sarcoma or lymphoma, leading to a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, germinal centre subtype.\n\nP: The patient was referred to haematology for further management and underwent chemotherapy. After 3 cycles, the patient achieved a complete radiological response. Follow-up care includes regular check-ups for monitoring recurrence and addressing any new symptoms or concerns.",
  "S: The patient was admitted to the emergency department with a 12-hour history of abdominal pain, distension, and bilious vomiting. They had no history of similar attacks before.\n\nO: The patient appeared dehydrated and afebrile, with a pulse of 98 per minute and blood pressure of 130/80. The abdomen was distended and tympanic on percussion with tinkling bowel sounds observed. An abdominal X-ray revealed multiple fluid levels without free air, confirming bowel occlusion. A CT scan identified a small bowel obstruction (SBO) with a transitional zone in the right lower abdomen, suggesting an internal hernia.\n\nA: The patient was diagnosed with a small bowel obstruction due to an internal hernia, which was confirmed radiologically and laparoscopically.\n\nP: A laparoscopic approach was recommended and performed using a three trocars technique, revealing an obstructive supravesical hernia involving the terminal ileum. The hernia was repaired without bowel resection as the incarcerated intestine was viable. The internal surface of the sac was cauterized and the hernia's ring was closed using a 2/0 Polydioxanone suture. The patient had a smooth recovery and was discharged on the fourth post-operative day. Two months later, the patient presented with a bulging mass in the right inguinal area and underwent a repair of a direct inguinal hernia.",

  "S: The patient is a 34-year-old primigravida referred to a tertiary care hospital due to suspicion of a chorioangioma or placental teratoma. She was diagnosed with pregnancy-induced hypertension but has no other known comorbidities. The pregnancy was planned without any medical intervention or assistance. There is no family history of congenital anomalies or twin pregnancies.\n\nO: An ultrasonography at the tertiary care hospital showed a single intrauterine fetus at 27 weeks and two days of gestation, with normal growth. A multiloculated cystic mass with septations and calcifications, lacking vascularity, was identified. A repeat scan confirmed the findings. At 36 weeks and five days, the patient delivered via C-section: one healthy fetus with good Apgar scores (9/1, 9/5) and a second congenitally malformed fetus. The placenta had two umbilical cords. Histopathological examination noted a placenta with gross malformations in one of the fetuses, including the absence of the head and upper limbs.\n\nA: Differential diagnoses considered included placental teratoma, chorioangioma, hemorrhagic placental degeneration, or degenerating fibroid. \n\nP: No specific treatment or follow-up plans were mentioned other than the patient being discharged in a stable condition. Further support and information are available as needed.",
  "S: The patient is a 32-year-old multiparous woman at 37 2/7 weeks of gestation, admitted for induction of labor due to abnormal antenatal testing. She has a history of prior cesarean delivery due to arrest of labor at 7 cm dilation. She chose to attempt a Trial of Labor After Cesarean (TOLAC) for this delivery. During induced labor, she experienced moderate vaginal bleeding.\n\nO: Initial cervical exam showed 2 cm dilation and 50% effacement. Labor was induced with oxytocin and amniotomy was performed at 5 cm dilation. The labor progression was from 2 cm to 5 cm in 10 hours and from 5 cm to 6 cm in 3.5 hours. There was minimal fetal heart rate variability and variable decelerations unresponsive to resuscitation, prompting a repeat cesarean delivery. No uterine rupture or significant placental abruption was noted during the surgery. A male infant was delivered weighing 2659 g with Apgar scores of 9 and arterial cord pH of 7.26. Post-delivery, a distended and edematous bladder was observed. A vaginal exam revealed spontaneous detachment and necrosis of the anterior rim of the cervix from 9 to 3 o'clock with the cervix detaching completely during attempted repair. There was no excessive bleeding.\n\nA: Concern for possible uterine rupture or placental abruption; however, none was observed. Cervical necrosis and spontaneous detachment occurred, with no excessive blood loss.\n\nP: The patient is stable post-surgery. Continued close monitoring during recovery is planned. An attempt to repair the cervical detachment was made. Further evaluation and monitoring of the lower uterine segment integrity behind the bladder are advised.",

The patient is advised to monitor his symptoms and report any changes or new symptoms immediately.",
  "S: The patient reported no noticeable symptoms related to the nasal tumor. The patient has a history of renal cancer and underwent surgery for it 5 years ago.\n\nO: A round tumor with a 10 mm diameter was found at the posterior end of the nasal septal mucosa. Imaging analyses, including CT and MRI, indicated a soft tissue mass at the junction of the nasal septum and roof of the nasopharynx. These images suggested a benign tumor. PET scan showed no abnormal uptake of 18F-fludeoxyglucose. Biopsy findings resembled a benign inverted ductal papilloma of the salivary glands, but a definitive diagnosis was not initially made. Hematoxylin-eosin staining of the excised tumor showed a papillary structure lined by columnar epithelium and spindle cells.\n\nA: The tumor excised is most likely a benign inverted ductal papilloma given the imaging and pathological findings.\n\nP: The tumor was successfully excised with a negative margin, indicating complete removal. The patient is advised to attend regular follow-up appointments to monitor recovery and check for any recurrence. The patient is expected to return to normal activities soon.",
  "S: The patient is an 80-year-old male who presented with bilateral posterior uveitis and cystoid macular edema (CME), which began approximately 5 months after starting nivolumab (Opdivo) for metastatic cancer with an unknown primary tumor. Initially, his best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/70 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye. After 6 months of treatment with oral prednisone, topical difluprednate (Durezol), and nepafenac (Nevanac), the CME resolved and vision improved to 20/30 in both eyes. However, 9 months later, foveal thinning and a full-thickness macular hole (FTMH) developed, reducing BCVA to 20/60 in the left eye. Vision further decreased to 20/150 after the macular hole reopened, but spontaneously closed again, improving vision to 20/80 in the left eye.\n\nO: Initial BCVA was 20/70 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye. Treatment led to vision improvement to 20/30 in both eyes. A subsequent FTMH reduced BCVA to 20/60 in the left eye. An OCT showed a closed macular hole with residual subretinal fluid. Vision decreased to 20/150 with reopening of the macular hole, then improved to 20/80 after spontaneous closure. Current stable condition with BCVA of 20/70.\n\nA: The patient has experienced fluctuating visual acuity due to bilateral posterior uveitis, CME, and recurrent FTMH, likely related to nivolumab therapy. The spontaneous resolution of the macular hole indicates a complex case requiring careful monitoring.\n\nP: The patient should continue monitoring vision regularly and maintain communication with the ophthalmologist. Immediate consultation is advised if there is any decrease in vision or new symptoms. Continued stability monitoring is essential given the history of variable ocular response.",

MRI revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the brain. A lumbar puncture showed albuminocytologic dissociation with elevated CSF protein (56 g/L), and electromyography indicated motor and sensory neuropathy. CSF cultures, VDRL, and antibodies to ganglioside GM1 were negative. The patient developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation. A CT scan without contrast revealed a hemorrhage in a metastatic lesion with vasogenic edema.\n\nA: The patient was diagnosed with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy (AIDP) based on clinical and laboratory findings.\n\nP: The treatment included switching to dabrafenib and trametinib, administering a second cycle of pembrolizumab, and providing methylprednisolone and IVIG treatment. After no improvement, plasmapheresis was initiated. Following a seizure, care was withdrawn due to a CT finding of hemorrhage in a metastatic brain lesion, leading to the patient's passing.",
  "S: The patient is a 19-year-old male who presented with a one-day history of left flank pain and dysuria. He also reports mild low back pain attributed to a past car accident. There is a family history of cervical cancer in his grandmother. As a child, he had a small lump on his right forehead, which was X-rayed at the time.\n\nO: Physical examination revealed mild tenderness to palpation on the thoracic and lumbar spine, a slightly more prominent right orbital rim, and a dark skin mark on the right front thigh along the L1-2 distribution. Initial lab tests showed bacteriuria and vitamin D deficiency. Normal results include complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, alkaline phosphatase levels, serum protein electrophoresis, and tumor markers (CEA and PSA). CT scans showed diffuse lumbar and thoracic spinal osseous lesions with osteoblastic and osteolytic features, and a small 4 mm non-specific pulmonary nodule. SPECT indicated ground-glass sclerotic lesions typical for fibrous dysplasia.\n\nA: The primary assessment is fibrous dysplasia, a benign disease process characterized by stable sclerotic lesions. There is no indication of metastatic malignancy or primary tumor.\n\nP: The plan includes ongoing monitoring of the patient's condition and symptom management. Regular follow-up appointments are recommended to ensure no significant changes in his condition.",
  "S: The patient reported a huge mass in the abdomen, weight loss, nausea, and gastric compression. They were initially fearful and refused surgery. Later, they experienced an emergency situation with incarcerated hernias due to intra-abdominal hypertension, leading to the acceptance of liver surgery.\n\nO: CT-Scan and MRI results showed aggressive disease in liver segments 2 to 8 with only a portion of the caudate lobe having visible parenchyma. The physical exam revealed a huge palpable mass involving nearly all abdominal quadrants. Regular controls showed increasing weight loss, low BMI, and severe bilateral lower limb varicose veins and edema due to IVC compression. Post-surgery, a follow-up CT-Scan showed huge hypertrophy of the remanent liver and small-sized remaining cysts.\n\nA: The patient initially presented with progressive liver disease impacting multiple segments with symptoms consistent with advanced liver pathology. Post-operatively, the patient has shown significant improvement, with resolution of digestive symptoms, weight gain, disappearance of the abdominal mass, and lower limb edema.\n\nP: The plan included an open liver resection and several non-anatomic resections with a bilateral sub-costal incision. A re-laparotomy was performed post-operatively for lavage due to hemorrhagic liquid and acute abdominal pain. The patient was discharged without further complications. Continued monitoring and follow-up were planned, with recent imaging showing successful surgical outcomes. The patient is advised to reach out with any concerns or questions.",
  "S: The patient reported experiencing pain, which led to a CT scan that detected a hypervascular mass lesion in the pancreas. They were referred for a 68Ga DOTATATE PET/CT scan to identify potential metastatic disease.\n\nO: The PET/CT scan showed a focus of uptake in the pancreas and moderate tracer uptake in several areas of the spine and right iliac wing. Further examination showed these areas exhibited characteristics of hemangiomas, not bone metastases. The CT images revealed bone demineralization with vertical striation and axial \"polka-dot\" appearances, indicative of benign hemangiomas.\n\nA: The imaging findings suggest that the areas of tracer uptake in the bones are due to hemangiomas, benign vascular growths, rather than metastatic disease. The hypervascular mass lesion in the pancreas remains to be monitored.\n\nP: The plan includes continued monitoring of the pancreatic mass lesion and the hemangiomas to ensure there are no changes. The patient should follow up with their primary care physician and schedule regular check-ups. They should also report any new or worsening symptoms to their doctor immediately. No immediate treatment or interventions are indicated based on the current imaging findings.",
  "S: The patient is a 63-year-old Japanese man with no prior medical history who presented with right-sided pleuritic chest pain and fever. After initial treatment for bacterial pneumonia with ceftriaxone, the fever of 39\u00b0C persisted.\n\nO: Initial tests showed a total leukocyte count of 7690/mm3 and a serum C-reactive protein level of 17.8 mg/dL. Liver and kidney functions were normal, and the sputum culture was negative. A chest CT revealed right basilar peripheral opacity and ipsilateral reactive pleural effusion. A follow-up contrast-enhanced CT showed increased right pleural effusion, aggravated infiltration, and a filling defect in the inferior lobar artery of the right lung. After 7 days, the patient's clinical status worsened with a leukocyte count increase to 15,300/mm3. Further CT imaging showed residual infiltration at the pulmonary embolism site with a 1.2 cm cavity, indicating progressive necrosis.\n\nA: The initial assessment was bacterial pneumonia, later identified as pulmonary embolism with reactive pleural effusion as the primary condition. The progression included pulmonary parenchymal necrosis at the embolism site in the right inferior lobe.\n\nP: The treatment plan evolved from ceftriaxone to include anticoagulation therapy, thoracic drainage, meropenem administration, and an escalation of the antibiotic protocol. Given the progressive necrosis and insufficient response to medical therapy, a surgical resection of the right lower lobe was performed to remove the affected lung portion. Pathology confirmed septic necrosis in the peripheral parenchyma of the infarcted lung.",
  "S: The patient is a 90-year-old male, initially admitted for lower abdominal pain, localized but without other symptoms like peritoneal irritation. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperuricemia. He denies any past surgeries or trauma. Following discharge, he presented again with a complaint of bloody stool, but denies having fever or recurring abdominal pain.\n\nO: Physical examination showed tenderness in the lower abdomen. Initial labs revealed anemia (hemoglobin 10.3 g/dL) and a low eGFR (35 mL/min/1.73m2). An abdominal CT identified a mesenteric hematoma with extravasation. Follow-up CT showed a reduction in mass size and absence of extravasation. At discharge, hemoglobin improved to 11.4 g/dL. Upon readmission, WBC count remains normal.\n\nA: Initial diagnosis is a mesenteric hematoma, with anemia being mild. Post-discharge assessment for bloody stool required, with considerations for gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\nP: Conservative therapy for mesenteric hematoma; close monitoring due to readmission with bloody stool. Continue to observe vital signs and monitor anemia status. Follow-ups arranged to monitor for any progression of anemia or other symptoms.",
  "\nS: The patient reports having recent casual headaches and has a history of chronic sinus issues following functional endoscopic sinus surgery and septoplasty in 1998. \n\nO: An MRI indicated a mass on the left side of the patient's clivus. A PET-CT was conducted to rule out a primary neoplasm. Post-surgery, the removed mass was identified as an ectopic pituitary adenoma, null cell type. The mass was isolated from the sellar and suprasellar area with no connection to the pituitary gland or stalk. No neurological deficits were observed post-surgery. \n\nA: The patient's headaches could be associated with the discovered mass on the clivus, which was determined to be an ectopic pituitary adenoma.\n\nP: The patient underwent a successful transsphenoidal endoscopy for the resection of the mass.

Genetic analysis found anomalies in the EN2 markers, specifically a 182-base deletion in one allele between 2475 and 2657 bases of the complementary sequence, C7 marker.\n\nA: The genetic anomaly in EN2 markers may be contributing to the symptoms of moderate mental retardation, microcephalus, and gait impairment.\n\nP: The plan involves continuing to monitor the child's condition and working with the family to establish the best course of care and treatment. No specific treatments or follow-up instructions were mentioned.",
  "S: The patient was recently diagnosed with stage III squamous cell carcinoma in the right mandible and underwent neck dissection, mandibular, and side resections. Since the surgery, the patient reports feeling okay overall but experiences tightness in the jaw, known as trismus. They have not noticed any issues with their bite, particularly on the left side.\n\nO: The surgery involved VSP simulation and CAD/CAM technology to fabricate surgical guides, leading to the reconstruction of the mandible with a fibula free flap (FFF). Panoramic radiographs taken 1 year and 3 months post-surgery show anterior dislocation of the right condyle and failure of the miniplates connecting the fibula to the right mandibular ascending ramus.\n\nA: The patient has experienced severe displacement of the right mandibular condyle due to failed miniplates, resulting in instability at the connection points of the fibula with the mandible.\n\nP: The plan involves scheduling another surgery to replace the broken plates and restore stability to the connection between the fibula and the right mandibular ascending ramus, aiming to prevent further displacement and complications. Postoperative progress will be closely monitored.",
  "S: The patient initially presented with a persistent unproductive cough and swollen lymph nodes in the neck in December 2016. Forty days post-transplantation, the patient experienced abdominal pain, diarrhea, a rash, and fever. There were transient expressions of BKV, CMV, and HBV.\n\nO: The biopsy of cervical lymph nodes revealed T-LBL, and a PET-CT scan showed multiple lymph node involvements leading to an Ann-Arbor stage III diagnosis. CD34+ cell count was 8.33 \u00d7 10^6/kg, and MNC count was 10.15 \u00d7 10^8/kg on the 12th day post-transplant. A chest CT showed diffuse ground-glass opacities, and an abdominal CT showed an enlarged spleen. BK DNA levels were 4.07 \u00d7 10^7 (copy/ml) initially and decreased to 1.05 \u00d7 10^5 (copy/ml). CMV-DNA in BALF was 3 \u00d7 10^6 during tracheoscopy.\n\nA: The patient was diagnosed with Ann-Arbor stage III T-LBL.

Antimicrobial treatments included meropenem and voriconazole, with antiviral treatments for BKV, CMV, and HBV. Continued monitoring and appropriate care will be needed.",
  "S: The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of acute respiratory failure due to severe aortic stenosis. She has a significant past medical history including a ventricular septal defect repair at age 10, a mitral valve replacement with a 27 mm Carpentier Edwards Magna Valve at age 57 due to progressive breathlessness caused by severe mitral regurgitation, and a redo mitral valve replacement with a 33 mm Carbomedics Valve due to stenotic prosthetic mitral valve six years later. The patient also has end-stage renal disease requiring haemodialysis.\n\nO: The patient's recent transthoracic echocardiography shows a degenerated bicuspid aortic valve with a peak velocity of 5.2 m/s, peak gradient 108 mmHg, mean gradient 68 mmHg, and an area of 0.43 cm2. The mitral valve prosthesis is functioning normally. Invasive coronary angiography indicates normal coronary arteries. The aortic annulus diameters and measurements are noted as a minimum diameter of 17 mm, maximum of 24 mm, perimeter 69 mm, and an area of 355 mm2. The common femoral arteries measure 6 mm bilaterally. The rim between the mitral valve prosthesis and the aortic annulus measures 10 mm.\n\nA: The patient's severe aortic stenosis, in conjunction with her history of multiple valve replacements and end-stage renal disease, and the technical considerations of TAVI, suggest she is a suitable candidate for TAVI despite the potential risks involved, such as valve embolization.\n\nP: The plan is to proceed with Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). The procedure will involve cannulating the right femoral artery and introducing a 14 French E-sheath. The annulus area is between two valve sizes, so a 23 mm or 26 mm Sapien S3 valve will be used. The valve will be crossed retrogradely using an Amplatz Left1 diagnostic catheter. The interaction between the TAVI valve and the mitral valve prosthesis has been assessed, and the risk of valve embolization is considered small. The patient will be kept informed, and her questions or concerns will be addressed throughout the process.",
  "S: The patient, a 6-year-old boy, reports experiencing limited forearm rotation and elbow flexion, which began after an injury approximately 2 months ago. The injury treatment involved an X-ray revealing a consolidated fracture of the ulna and a radial head dislocation, known as a neglected Monteggia fracture. Following diagnosis, the patient underwent an open reduction of the radial head and an osteotomy of the ulna, followed by treatment with a LCP combined with a cast. The recovery has been uneventful with no reported problems or pain.\n\nO: The doctor observes the patient\u2019s ability to rotate the forearm and flex the elbow, noting improvement in movement.\n\nA: Neglected Monteggia fracture with limited forearm rotation and elbow flexion post-injury and surgical treatment.

Further evaluation of symptoms and response to treatment will guide ongoing management.",
  "S: The patient is a breast cancer survivor, initially diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma, histology grade 2, with positive estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2, alongside a Ki67 of 10%. Post-mastectomy, she received chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. Six years later, she was diagnosed with bone metastasis in the vertebra and treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Later, she developed liver metastasis and encountered adverse effects from treatment, leading to changes in her therapy regimen. She has been on bone-modifying agents for 8 years and experienced atypical femoral fractures, with persistent left hip pain progressing to a displaced femoral subtrochanteric fracture.\n\nO: Examination of the fracture site revealed no signs of metastatic lesions. Radiography showed a beak on the lateral side of the fracture area with cortical bone sclerosis, indicative of an atypical femoral fracture (AFF). The patient experienced temporary right hip pain and persistent left hip pain, resulting in a fracture after a fall. \n\nA: The patient has a history of invasive ductal carcinoma with metastatic progression to bone and liver. Current concerns focus on managing atypical femoral fractures, likely related to long-term use of bone-modifying agents, rather than metastatic disease.\n\nP: The treatment plan will prioritize addressing the atypical femoral fracture while monitoring the status of breast cancer and its metastases. Detailed treatment options will be discussed to tailor interventions to the patient's needs, focusing on both orthopedic and oncologic aspects.",

A transesophageal echocardiogram showed small vegetation on the mitral valve with mild regurgitation.\n\nA: \nThe patient appears to have a lumbar epidural abscess, vertebral osteomyelitis, and discitis secondary to bacteremia with C hominis. There is evidence of infective endocarditis with small mitral valve vegetation and mild regurgitation.\n\nP: \nThe treatment plan involves intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g once daily for a duration of 6 weeks to manage the infection. A computed tomography\u2013guided needle biopsy of L4-L5 will be carried out for further investigation. The patient will continue treatment post-discharge, with reassessment planned after the treatment course. Unfortunately, the patient later expired at an outside facility due to an unknown illness.",
  "S: The patient is a 67-year-old Hispanic female with a history of stage II B (T4aN0M0) melanoma of the clitoris, initially presenting with a pigmented vulvar lesion over the clitoris that occasionally bled. The lesion, which started growing and turned very dark, prompted her to seek medical treatment in January 2015. Her medical history includes hypothyroidism, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastritis, along with a total hysterectomy and a left breast lumpectomy for a benign cyst. During her recent six-month follow-up, she reported symptoms of feeling \"as if there's a piece of paper hanging from her vagina,\" constant burning pain on the anterior surface of the vulva, and dyspareunia.\n\nO: Examination of the lesion previously showed a malignant melanoma with a thickness of 8.0 mm. Pathology after local excision revealed no ulceration, lymphovascular or perineural invasion, and negative margins. A follow-up re-excision was negative for melanoma. A PET scan in March 2015 and a biopsy of the left inguinal sentinel lymph node in April 2015 were negative for metastasis. Recent physical exam showed no signs of recurrence, and a pap test was negative.\n\nA: The patient's melanoma appears to be in remission, given the negative re-excision and PET scan results, as well as the absence of lymph node involvement. Current symptoms of burning pain and dyspareunia may be related to other gynecological issues, but recurrence of melanoma has been ruled out.\n\nP: The plan is to continue observation, as previous examinations and tests show the melanoma is not active. The patient has been referred to gynecology for further evaluation of her symptoms, and the pap test was negative. She is advised to monitor symptoms and report any changes or worsening to her healthcare provider.",

  "S: The patient reported experiencing a pruritic rash on the trunk and both upper and lower extremities, which was described as very uncomfortable. The patient previously underwent several treatments including topical halobetasol, topical tacrolimus, oral antihistamines, prednisone, and mycophenolate mofetil, none of which were effective. Treatment with dupilumab initially led to dramatic improvement, but the rash returned after discontinuation due to insurance issues. Upon restarting dupilumab after insurance reapproval, the patient experienced complete resolution of the rash and pruritus.\n\nO: Examination revealed lichenified papules throughout the trunk and extremities, predominantly on the back. Biopsy results indicated mild spongiosis with superficial and deep perivascular infiltrate.\n\nA: The patient initially did not respond to several treatments but showed a marked improvement with dupilumab, indicating that the rash is likely refractory to conventional treatments but responsive to biologic therapy.\n\nP: Continue dupilumab therapy as prescribed with close follow-up to monitor the condition. The patient should report any changes or concerns promptly. Regular follow-ups are necessary to ensure ongoing management and effectiveness of the treatment.",
  "S: The patient, an 8-year-old girl, has been experiencing rhinitis and was prescribed a nasal spray by a Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner to use twice a day for 10 days. Since starting the nasal spray, she developed severe abdominal colic, vomiting, constipation, and fatigue.\n\nO: The patient's venous blood lead level (BLL) is 91 \u03bcg/dL, indicating a high level of lead. The nasal spray contained 22.3% lead. Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatine kinase at 747 U/L, creatine kinase isoenzyme MB at 14.8 ng/mL, AST at 119 U/L, and ALT at 390 U/L. An abdominal radiograph revealed shadows of stool and gas, along with points of increased density, though the radiopaque particles' lead content could not be determined.\n\nA: The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest lead poisoning, likely due to the lead content in the nasal spray.\n\nP: Administer folium sennae as a cathartic to eliminate lead from the intestine before starting chelation therapy. Initiate chelation therapy with regular monitoring of white blood cell count, particularly after 2 days to assess for potential decreases. If the white blood cell count falls, adjust the treatment accordingly. Continue therapy with an intravenous infusion of CaNa2EDTA, aiming to lower the BLL to safer levels, such as 36 \u03bcg/dL, by the end of the treatment period.",
  "S: The patient is a 44-year-old male immigrant with a history of neurocysticercosis after consuming uncooked pork in Mexico. He underwent a craniotomy to remove a brain mass in Mexico. He has noted new bilateral parotid gland masses, with the left side being larger. The patient was vaccinated against tuberculosis, and his work-up for systemic tuberculosis was negative. He suspected the masses to be cysticercosis lesions.\n\nO: CT scan of the neck with i.v. contrast showed bilateral parotid masses, with a dominant ring-enhancing, hypodense lesion in the left superficial parotid gland measuring 3.0 \u00d7 2.9 cm. A left superficial parotidectomy was performed, revealing a large yellowish fluid-filled cyst. Micropathology indicated a squamous epithelium-lined cyst with lymphoepithelial complexes, consistent with a lymphoepithelial cyst. Serological studies confirmed HIV infection.\n\nA: The patient has been diagnosed with HIV infection following the finding of a lymphoepithelial cyst in the left parotid gland, raising suspicion for the disease.\n\nP: The plan is to manage the patient's HIV infection through appropriate medications and lifestyle modifications.

The patient also reports black spots on both palms and soles, with the left second finger and left fifth toe turning black. \n\nO: Vital signs: temperature 39.8 \u00b0C, heart rate 130 beats/min, blood pressure 100/71 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Exam findings include orientation with garrulous behavior, petechial hemorrhages on the uvula and posterior pharynx, no cardiac murmurs, blackened left second finger and left fifth toe, petechiae on right palm, and the dorsum of the left foot is erythematous, warm, and swollen. Initial lab results indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), elevated white blood cell count, and elevated C-reactive protein. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus pyogenes. Echocardiography revealed vegetation on the mitral valve and mitral regurgitation (MR).\n\nA: The patient is likely experiencing streptococcal pharyngitis and a skin and soft tissue infection leading to bacteremia and DIC, suspected to be caused by Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes). There is also new onset mitral regurgitation due to mitral valve vegetation, likely due to an infection.\n\nP: Start IV clindamycin and switch to ampicillin based on susceptibility testing. Continue close monitoring of the patient\u2019s condition, especially the cardiac status, due to the development of mitral valve vegetation. Discuss further treatment options for mitral regurgitation. Maintain follow-up examinations and consider potential surgical intervention if necessary.",
  "S: The patient has a history of a long-standing swelling on the left lower leg, initially confirmed as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) via biopsy. The patient underwent a wide local excision with clear margins and no distant metastases, so no adjuvant therapy was administered at that time. Two years later, a recurrence led to another excision followed by a second recurrence involving the knee joint, which necessitated a transfemoral amputation. After two years, the disease recurred again at the left lower limb stump. A metastatic workup returned negative results. The patient experienced progression of lesions on the limb stump and posterior torso, which led to referral for further management. The patient reports some pain but an overall feeling of improvement with the prosthetic limb.\n\nO: The physical examination revealed a 15 x 12 cm mobile mass on the left lower limb stump, and two palpable, firm, and fixed lesions on the posterior torso, with the largest measuring 9 x 7 cm. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for CD34, focally positive for actin, and negative for desmin and S100 protein. A chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of metastasis.\n\nA: Recurrence of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans with progression after the initial and subsequent excisions. The condition has led to multiple lesions in the posterior torso and a significant mass on the left lower limb stump, with no evidence of distant metastases.\n\nP: The patient initially started on imatinib mesylate at 400 mg twice daily, but the treatment stopped after progression of lesions. Palliative radiotherapy was administered to the left lower limb stump for pain relief and to allow the use of a prosthetic limb. Continued monitoring of symptoms and progression is advised, with the recommendation to report any new symptoms. Reassessment of the treatment plan will be conducted as necessary.",
  "S: The patient was diagnosed with bifocal invasive ductal breast cancer in 2006 and underwent mastectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. She was in remission and took tamoxifen for five years. Recently, she developed severe dorsal pain.\n\nO: The MR study revealed signs of diffuse medullary metastatic disease in the spine, particularly in the dorsal segment, affecting the T2-T3 level and molding the posterior medulla. Leptomeningeal metastatic spread with small nodular foci were observed on the spinal cord and dorsal roots. Bone deposits were found in the right pedicle of T4 and vertebral body of T7. No signs of brain or intramedullary metastatic disease or CSF blockage were noted. The disease showed homogenous gadolinium uptake.\n\nA: The patient is experiencing metastatic spread to the spine and leptomeningeal areas, with associated dorsal pain likely due to these findings.\n\nP: The plan includes delivering a 30Gy radiotherapy treatment to reduce the metastatic sleeve volume at the thoracic level, aiming for partial symptom relief and reduction in analgesic medication dosage.

The patient should continue to avoid allergens like eggs and cow's milk and maintain the current skincare routine. Further steps will be discussed in subsequent consultations.",
  "S: The patient reports experiencing left-sided mastodynia and has a history of excisional biopsy for a fibroadenoma in the left breast.\n\nO: An MRI showed no findings to explain the patient's complaints but revealed a 7 mm enhancing stellate lesion in the right breast at 9 o'clock, with a homogeneously low signal on T1-weighted images and rapid early enhancement with plateau kinetics on dynamic contrast imaging. No diffusion restriction was noted. Mammography identified a focal asymmetric density with spiculated margins in the superolateral quadrant of the right breast, without associated microcalcifications. A second-look ultrasound displayed a 4 mm oval hypoechoic mass with partially obscured borders. The biopsy histologically showed an infiltrative stromal process suggesting a desmoid tumor, but no nuclear atypia or mitosis was observed.\n\nA: Discrepancy between suspicious morphological findings and dynamic characteristics resulted in a further evaluation that revealed a BI-RADS 4b lesion, suspected to be a desmoid tumor confirmed by biopsy as fibromatosis.\n\nP: Recommended wide excision to remove the tumor, which confirmed the diagnosis of fibromatosis. Further questions or concerns from the patient are encouraged for discussion.",
  "S: The patient is a 26-year-old primigravida woman who was admitted due to labor complications during the second stage, with a suspected intrauterine infection. She underwent an emergency caesarean section due to these complications and experienced severe postpartum hemorrhage. The patient reported severe dyspnea after receiving a blood transfusion. She also found the caesarean section experience to be traumatic and sought psychological help.\n\nO: The patient experienced a blood loss of 2 liters and was treated with sulprostone, intravenous fluids, and a blood transfusion. Chest X-rays showed congestion, and echocardiography indicated severe left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 15% and moderate basal septal wall motility. There was no ischaemia or coagulopathy. Follow-up echocardiography showed normalization of left ventricular function.\n\nA: The initial suspicion of peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) was reconsidered, concluding that the patient likely suffered from takotsubo cardiomyopathy due to the nature of the delivery and rapid recovery of cardiac function. The absence of ischaemia and specific echocardiography findings supported this diagnosis.\n\nP: The patient was treated with conventional heart failure medications and quickly extubated following therapy initiation. She underwent cardiac follow-ups and her left ventricular function remains normal. Future pregnancies were deemed safe, and she has since had several uncomplicated pregnancies with no cardiac issues. Psychological counseling was also part of her management to address trauma.",

Further follow-up is required to monitor recovery and manage any remaining concerns from the delivery.",
  "S: The patient reports progressive deterioration of renal function after starting immunotherapy with nivolumab for lung cancer. They were diagnosed in April 2016 with stage IIIa non-small cell lung cancer in the upper lobe of the right lung and initially treated with radiotherapy and six cycles of chemotherapy, including paclitaxel and carboplatin. In March 2017, a PET/CT scan showed malignant extension to the tracheobronchial and subcarinal lymph nodes. The patient has a significant smoking history of 35 years, smoking 20 cigarettes per day, but no other comorbidities. They take no regular medications apart from simple analgesics and report no drug or food allergies. Family history is unremarkable.\n\nO: On physical examination, the patient had a normal body temperature of 36.7\u00b0C, blood pressure of 135/70 mmHg, and a pulse rate of 80 bpm. Before immunotherapy, renal function was normal with a serum creatinine of 79.56 \u03bcmol/L and an eGFR of 92.5 ml/min/1.73m2. After the 7th infusion of nivolumab, renal function was impaired with a serum creatinine of 176.8 \u03bcmol/L and an eGFR of 35.2 ml/min/1.73m2. After two additional cycles of nivolumab, serum creatinine doubled and eGFR declined to 14.8 ml/min/1.73m2.\n\nA: The patient is experiencing a progressive deterioration of renal function likely associated with nivolumab immunotherapy, given the significant increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR following treatment. \n\nP: The plan includes monitoring the patient's renal function closely and discussing potential treatment options. The patient will need to keep the medical team updated on any changes in health status. No new medications or nephrotoxic agents have been prescribed.",
  "S: The patient has a history of acromegaly and underwent transsphenoidal pituitary resection three weeks prior. Post-surgery, the patient experienced a severe, intermittent, throbbing headache that worsened upon standing or coughing and improved with acetaminophen and lying down. The patient also reported clear nasal discharge since the removal of a nasal splint.\n\nO: Initial examination showed normal vital signs and a normal neurological exam, with minimal clear nasal discharge observed. A CT scan revealed multiple air loculi in the basal cisterns, lateral, third, and fourth ventricles, without mass effect or midline shift. A follow-up CT scan showed mild increased diffuse pneumocephalus with intracranial air loculi, and an increased amount of air in the posterior fossa causing a mass effect on the pons. After surgical intervention, the patient's headache and nasal leakage resolved, and a subsequent CT scan confirmed the resolution of pneumocephalus.\n\nA: The patient likely experienced a pneumocephalus post-pituitary surgery, causing the reported symptoms, confirmed by CT findings. The increase in intracranial air led to the decision for further surgical intervention.\n\nP: Initial management included bed rest in the Fowler position at 30\u00b0 and avoiding Valsalva maneuvers. Due to worsening symptoms and CT findings, the plan included a transsphenoidal endoscopic exploration, septoplasty, and packing of the sphenoid sinus with an abdominal fat graft, along with the insertion of a lumbar drain. After successful procedures, the lumbar drain was removed five days later, and the patient was discharged on day 10 of hospitalization. Follow-up confirmed the resolution of symptoms, and the patient was advised to monitor for any recurrence or new symptoms.",
  "S: The patient reports having acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and experiencing a severe reaction to pentamidine treatments, which included severe abdominal pain, emesis, diarrhea, lightheadedness, and near-fainting. They initially developed a nonspecific rash without mucosal involvement from trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, leading to initiation of IV pentamidine. The patient also experienced intense abdominal pain, hypotension, and poor perfusion during a platelet infusion, and now reports isolated urticarial flares with each pentamidine desensitization.\n\nO: An abdominal X-ray showed non-obstructive gas patterns with small bowel wall thickening. An abdominal CT scan revealed colonic wall thickening and concern for ischemic colitis. MR enterography showed a nonocclusive thrombus involving the celiac trunk, proximal hepatic, and splenic arteries. Pathology from a partial colectomy (mid transverse colon to mid distal colon) showed patchy transmural ischemic colitis without local thrombosis or emboli. A paired two-tailed Wilcoxon test showed significant changes in platelet levels (P value <0.0001).\n\nA: The patient has a confirmed pentamidine allergy and has experienced ischemic colitis likely secondary to nonocclusive thrombi and chemotherapy complications.\n\nP: Continue with a pentamidine desensitization protocol and monitor for isolated urticarial flares. Monitor platelet levels closely due to significant changes noted. Instruct the patient to report any new or worsening symptoms promptly.",
  "S: The patient reported a visual change in the left eye, describing vision as blurry and distorted. The patient has a history of choroidal melanoma in the left eye, confirmed through histopathology. In January 2016, surveillance imaging revealed hepatic lesions in the liver, which by August 2016 had increased in size and number. The patient expresses concern about the seriousness of the condition and seeks clarification on the findings and treatment plans.\n\nO: The largest hepatic lesion measured 7.1 \u00d7 5.8 cm (M1b) in August 2016. Laboratory findings included an LDH level of 641 U/L and ALP level of 111 U/L. A liver biopsy confirmed metastatic uveal melanoma. Subsequent imaging in November 2016 showed a marked decrease in size and number of liver lesions. However, imaging in September 2018 displayed disease progression, leading to a treatment adjustment. As of March 2019, the patient is experiencing stable disease.\n\nA: The patient was initially diagnosed with choroidal melanoma, which metastasized to the liver, confirmed as metastatic uveal melanoma (MUM). The patient responded to initial treatment but later experienced disease progression.\n\nP: Treatment initially included nivolumab and ipilimumab therapy with TACE every 4 weeks starting in September 2016. Maintenance nivolumab was started in January 2017 until disease progression in September 2018. Treatment was then changed to nab-paclitaxel with continued TACE every 8 weeks. The current plan is to maintain therapy and monitor the patient's condition through regular check-ups and imaging to track disease stability and manage accordingly.",

  "S: The patient is a 29-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 0, hospitalized at 32+2 weeks of gestation for unexplained lower abdominal pain. She was diagnosed with a threatened premature delivery and treated with phloroglucinol for tocolysis and dexamethasone for fetal lung maturation. Following treatment, her abdominal pain was relieved, but she experienced continuous abdominal distension.\n\nO: Initial ultrasound showed monochorionic triplet gestation with discrepancies in fetal weights and a single umbilical cord looped around one fetus's neck. Placental function was grades I and II, with no signs of FFTS. Doppler and non-stress tests only showed mild abnormality later on. On the fourth day, fetuses were estimated at 33 and 32 weeks. By 4:30 am on the fifth day, fetal heartbeats and movements ceased. Postmortem, fetuses A and C were thin and pale (weight: 1700g and 1800g), while fetus B was heavier and red (weight: 2100g). Internal examinations showed anemia in A and C, and congestion/hemorrhage in B. Placental examination revealed arterio-arterial and arterio-venous anastomoses with differences in placental blood flow and placental villi anemia.\n\nA: The differential diagnosis suggests placental blood flow discrepancies and anemia as contributing factors to fetal demise. There were no signs of twin-twin transfusion syndrome during the pregnancy, though postmortem findings indicate possible unequal sharing of placental resources.\n\nP: The patient is advised to schedule a follow-up appointment with her obstetrician to discuss recovery, future pregnancy considerations, and precautions. Further monitoring and evaluation of the patient\u2019s recovery process are recommended.",
  "S: The patient is a 12-year-old male with a history of cutaneous bleeding and a mild reduction in platelet count. He reports experiencing some bleeding issues and easy bruising. A genetic variant in the GATA1 gene was found, which is associated with his symptoms. There is also a consideration regarding a rare X-linked blood group phenotype known as Lu(a-b-).\n\nO: The patient's platelet count is 101 \u00d7 10^9/L. A stop-loss variant in the GATA1 gene, c.1240T>C, p.*414Arg+41, has been identified. There is no presence of giant macrothrombocytes observed in histological examinations, and serological analysis for the Lu(a-b-) phenotype has not been conducted.\n\nA: The patient presents with cutaneous bleeding and easy bruising likely due to the GATA1 genetic variant. The absence of giant macrothrombocytes and pending serological analysis for the Lu(a-b-) phenotype are also noted.\n\nP: The plan includes continuing to monitor the patient's platelet count and symptoms. The patient is advised to avoid situations where he might be at risk of injury or bleeding. Further analysis for the Lu(a-b-) phenotype is suggested through serological methods if clinically indicated. Regular follow-up to assess any changes in symptoms or condition is recommended.",
  "S: The patient is a 56-year-old retired male with a 6-year history of Parkinson's Disease. He originally experienced a right-handed tremor, which led to a diagnosis of PD. Initially treated with carbidopa-levodopa with poor relief, he underwent Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) three years ago, which helped with the right-handed tremor. However, he developed a left-handed tremor and bradykinesia, requiring increased dosages of carbidopa-levodopa. The patient reports behavioral changes, including apathy, poor communication, hypersexuality, anger, and impulsivity. A month prior to the presentation, he attempted suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nO: Previously documented oxygen saturation was 94% and arterial blood gas study showed a carboxyhemoglobin level of 49.3%.\n\nA: The patient has Parkinson's Disease with motor symptom control issues and significant neuropsychiatric symptoms. History of a suicide attempt indicates severe mental health challenges possibly related to Parkinsonian treatment.\n\nP: Continue to monitor and adjust carbidopa-levodopa dosage and DBS settings for motor symptom control. Address mental health concerns through ongoing psychiatric consultations and support. Ensure regular follow-ups to monitor behavioral changes and medication effects.",
  "S: The patient reports experiencing symptoms since age 12, including mucohemorrhagic diarrhea, tenesmus, abdominal pain, and frequent bowel movements (over 10 times a day). The patient was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis and treated with mesalazine, prednisone, metronidazole, azathioprine, infliximab, and adalimumab, but did not find these treatments effective. An off-label treatment with thalidomide was initially helpful but led to new symptoms: irritability, decreased need for sleep, increased activity, disorganized behavior and speech, inflated self-esteem, and nonsensical thoughts. After discontinuing thalidomide, the patient experienced temporary improvement but later developed more severe symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, suspiciousness, hostility, withdrawal, and somatic concerns. The patient continues to feel suspicious, withdrawn, and experiences hallucinations.\n\nO: General and neurological examinations, laboratory tests, and brain MRI showed normal results. The patient's electroencephalogram showed slow waves with isolated spikes in the right temporal and parietal regions. There is no history of obstetric complications, neurological or psychiatric diseases, or substance abuse. Normal early childhood neurodevelopmental milestones and IQ were reported by the parents.\n\nA: The patient was initially diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis and had a suboptimal response to several standard treatments. The development of psychiatric symptoms during thalidomide treatment suggests a possible drug-induced condition or an emergence of a primary psychiatric disorder coinciding with drug therapy. The patient's ongoing symptoms of hallucinations, delusions, and withdrawal may indicate a complex neuropsychiatric condition requiring further evaluation.\n\nP: The plan includes monitoring symptoms and adjusting the treatment plan as needed. Mesalazine-based treatment was restarted. Continued assessment and consideration of alternative therapies or psychiatric interventions may be required. Ongoing communication with the healthcare team about any symptom changes or new concerns is emphasized to ensure the patient's well-being.",

They mention managing the condition with glimepiride and metformin but have recently run out of medication before a scheduled appointment. The patient has experienced cognitive decline and slight forgetfulness. They report their blood sugar control has worsened after switching to teneligliptin. However, they noticed improvement with exenatide-LAR injections. Outpatient treatment has become difficult for the patient.\n\nO: The patient's body weight is 41.7 kg, with a BMI of 20.1 kg/m2. Liver function tests show an AST of 24 IU/mL, and renal function tests reveal a creatinine level of 0.68 mg/dL, both within normal ranges. The patient has no diabetic complications. An increase in hemoglobin A1c levels to 10.2% was noted after switching medications, but it decreased to 7.1% after administering exenatide-LAR weekly. HbA1c levels remained in the 6-7% range with a reduced frequency of injections. Fasting glucose remained stable before injections.\n\nA: The patient likely experienced an overdose of glimepiride and metformin due to cognitive decline, prompting a switch to teneligliptin. The change initially worsened blood sugar control, but administration of exenatide-LAR improved it significantly. Outpatient treatment poses challenges for the patient, necessitating alternative solutions.\n\nP: Transition to exenatide-LAR injections has improved glycemic control, with adjustments to dosing intervals based on the patient's response. Continue managing diabetes with once-monthly exenatide-LAR injections. Discuss and explore alternatives to support the patient in receiving treatment effectively, given the current difficulties with outpatient care.",
  "S: The patient reports feeling down and anxious for the past 3 years and believes their memory is worsening. They also mention experiencing some clumsiness. The patient is concerned about these symptoms possibly being related to their father\u2019s history of dementia. Additionally, they note a family history of panic disorder in their son, who shares a genetic variant with the patient.\n\nO: The neurologic examination revealed mild cerebellar ataxia. A CT scan showed marked calcification in areas of the brain, including the bilateral globus pallidus, caudate nuclei, pulvinar thalami, and dentate nuclei.\n\nA: The patient's symptoms and CT findings suggest depression, anxiety, and mild cognitive impairment. The similarity in calcification patterns seen in the patient's father and the genetic variant shared with the son implies a possible genetic component.\n\nP: Develop a treatment plan to address depression, anxiety, and mild cognitive impairment with regular follow-ups to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed. Close monitoring of family members for changes in mental health or cognitive function is recommended.",
  "S: The patient reported experiencing weakness in the right arm and leg for about one year.

A partial response (PR) was expected, with close monitoring of the patient's condition.",
  "S: The patient is a recent recipient of an allograft transplant due to end-stage renal failure caused by hypertension and primary antiphospholipid syndrome. They have a history of thrombosis in their arteriovenous fistula and neck veins and were on warfarin. Post-transplant, they developed a renal hematoma and later experienced reduced urine output, progressive abdominal distension, pain, and fever. \n\nO: The patient had a 13 cm \u00d7 7 cm renal hematoma noted on ultrasound, and a CT scan showed a fluid collection posterior to the allograft. Three weeks post-surgery, ultrasound revealed a large perigraft collection, resulting in the discovery of a urinoma and a suspected anastomotic leak. During surgical exploration, an allograft vascular pedicle and a completely sloughed off allograft ureter were found. \n\nA: The patient's symptoms and surgical findings suggest complications related to the renal transplant, including a probable anastomotic leak and urinoma. \n\nP: The plan included placing a passive external drain, surgical exploration, and reconstruction. The sloughed allograft ureter was excised, and the native ureter was approximated to the graft. The patient is advised to closely monitor for symptoms or changes in urine output and adhere to prescribed medications and follow-up instructions.",
  "S: The patient is an 85-year-old woman who recently experienced minor trauma from falling while walking, resulting in pain in her right leg. She has a history of right total hip arthroplasty 18 years ago, followed by revision arthroplasty 9 years ago due to loosening of the femoral stem. She has been taking alendronate for more than five years.\n\nO: Initial radiographs revealed localized thickening of the lateral femoral cortical bone and a complete transverse fracture with internal spikes, as well as a third bone fragment with findings indicative of an atypical femoral fracture. A Vancouver type B1 periprosthetic fracture was diagnosed. Radiographs from five months prior showed cortical bone thinning and transverse lucency near the tip of the stable femoral stem. Post-operative radiographs at a three-month follow-up showed no displacement or loosening of implants.\n\nA: The assessment is a Vancouver type B1 periprosthetic fracture around the prosthetic implant, likely resulting from an incomplete fracture that became complete over time.\n\nP: The treatment plan involves an open reduction and internal fixation using a locking plate with cable grip. Post-surgery, alendronate use will be discontinued; the patient will receive weekly subcutaneous injections of 56.5 \u03bcg teriparatide along with LIPUS.

An echocardiogram demonstrated moderate concentric LVH with septal hypertrophy, moderate global hypokinesis of the left ventricle, an ejection fraction between 25-30%, a moderately dilated right ventricle with mildly reduced systolic function, and mildly dilated atria. Cardiac MRI revealed high normal LV size, severely increased LV mass, global hypokinesis, moderate hypertrophy, impaired biventricular systolic function, moderate bi-atrial dilatation, mildly raised extracellular volume (ECV) 0.36, and diffuse subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement, without inflammation or edema on STIR. A perfusion scan showed severe circumferential inducible ischemia, transmural fibrosis, and signs of iron overload in the liver and spleen. Coronary angiography revealed a 70% stenosis over the left anterior descending artery. SAP scintigraphy and Technetium labelled scan showed no visceral amyloid uptake and no significant abnormalities.\n\nA: Initial impressions centered on amyloidosis; however, further evaluations contradicted this diagnosis. Clinical findings suggest an infiltrative process with notable cardiac and systemic involvement.\n\nP: Continued monitoring and evaluation of the patient's condition is necessary to determine the optimal treatment plan. Consider addressing the identified cardiac issues and potential iron overload, while ruling out alternative diagnoses to amyloidosis. Further follow-up and investigation into the underlying cause of symptoms are recommended.",
  "S: The patient, a 12-year-old boy with a known case of hemophilia A, reports swelling and pain in multiple joints and an intermittent fever for the past 13 days. The swelling began in the left elbow, followed by pain, and later affected the right elbow, left knee, and right shoulder joints. The fever is high-grade, coming and going, and improves with antipyretics. The patient's history includes similar episodes of joint aches since birth, relieved by FVIII injections and blood transfusions. He also experiences non-traumatic epistaxis and skin bruising, and had difficulty with blood clotting during circumcision. All vaccinations are up to date. He is the first child and has a younger brother with similar health issues.\n\nO: The patient is oriented to time, place, and person with a Glasgow coma scale of 15/15. Vitals are as follows: heart rate of 88 beats/min, blood pressure of 110/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and a temperature of 102\u00b0F. There are no visible bruises noted on examination.\n\nA: The patient's symptoms and history are consistent with joint bleeding episodes associated with hemophilia A, compounded by a febrile illness that could be due to infection or another inflammatory process.\n\nP: The plan includes monitoring the patient's condition closely and providing appropriate treatment for the fever and joint symptoms. Consideration for treatment with FVIII replacement to address hemophilia-related bleeding and further evaluation to determine the cause of the fever and joint symptoms. Consultation with a hematologist may be necessary. Continue monitoring for any additional symptoms or complications.",
  "S: The patient has been experiencing abdominal pain for the past 4 days, hypotension, perspiration, and drowsiness following an aggressive, blunt trauma.\n\nO: Examination revealed tenderness and rebound tenderness in the abdomen with 2 periumbilical ecchymoses and several ecchymoses in the left deltoid area and lower limbs. Abdominal sonography showed peritoneal fluid with fibrin, while chest X-rays were unremarkable. Blood tests showed normal hemoglobin and white blood cell counts, but elevated creatinine (4.04 mg/dL), urea (209 mg/dL), mild acidosis (lactate 21 mmol/L), creatinine-kinase (1910 U/L), lactate-dehydrogenase (451 U/L), and ethanol (34 mg/dL). Post-surgery findings included 2 perforations on the ileum, general peritonitis with pus, and multiple intraperitoneal abscesses. Patient is in septic shock with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), on mechanical ventilation, inotropic support, sedation, and has a fever of 38.5 \u00baC.\n\nA: The patient has ileal perforations with general peritonitis and septic shock with MODS, complicated by multiple intraperitoneal abscesses and infections including S. putrefaciens, S. cerevisiae, Candida species, and Acinetobacter baumannii.\n\nP: The patient underwent an enterectomy, end-ileostomy, saline lavage, drain placements, and laparostomy. Empirical therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics (ertapenem, vancomycin) was initiated, informed by an antibiogram. Further surgical intervention addressed intraperitoneal abscesses. Susceptible organisms are being treated with appropriate antibiotics (amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, third-generation cephalosporins, fluconazole, colistin). Continuous monitoring and supportive care in the ICU are ongoing.",
  "S:  \nThe patient is a known case of alpha thalassemia, specifically HbH disease, and has been experiencing fever and chills for the past week. The patient did not report any other symptoms or signs of infection.\n\nO:  \nInitial physical examination findings were unremarkable. The patient has pancytopenia with the following lab results: hemoglobin at 7.3 g/dL, white cell count at 1.68 \u00d7 10^9/L, and platelet count at 92 \u00d7 10^9/L. C-reactive protein was 24, and procalcitonin was 0.14. Renal function, liver enzymes, chest X-ray, and urinalysis were unremarkable. Blood and urine cultures, as well as Dengue NS 1 antigen, were negative. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed hepatosplenomegaly with no intra-abdominal abscesses. Peripheral blood film indicated marked leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anisopoikilocytosis with microcytosis, target cells, and tear drop cells, consistent with thalassemia intermedia. Bone marrow examination revealed hypocellular marrow, marked erythroid hypoplasia, rare giant erythroblasts, inclusion bodies, and increased macrophages with active haemophagocytosis.\n\nA:  \nThe clinical impression is that the patient's condition is more severe than HbH disease alone, with findings suggestive of a more complex hematological disorder possibly involving significant marrow dysfunction.\n\nP:  \nThe plan involves closely monitoring the patient\u2019s blood counts and adjusting treatment as needed. The patient is advised to report any new symptoms or changes in condition immediately. The current medication was changed from piperacillin-tazobactam to carbapenem after negative cultures and persistent fever. Further observation and management will be based on ongoing assessments and lab findings.",
  "S: The patient reports a central scotoma in the right eye for about 5 months, with no prior symptoms or family history of eye problems. Despite previous treatment, the patient has noticed no improvement in vision and is now experiencing obvious metamorphosis.\n\nO: Initial findings showed corrected visual acuity from 8/20 to 10/20, atypical pigmentary alterations, local serous detachment in the central fovea, persistent sub-retinal fluid, and FCE. After half-dose PDT treatment, sub-retinal fluid resolved, but after 3 months, sub-macular hemorrhage and CNV lesion in FCE breaking through the retinal pigment epithelium were noted, causing metamorphosis.\n\nA: The patient has continued symptoms related to central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) with the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) causing metamorphosis in the affected eye.\n\nP: Monitor the patient's condition closely. Schedule a follow-up appointment to reassess the eye and explore additional treatment options for the CNV lesion. Advise the patient to report any vision changes or concerns.",

  "S: The patient reports experiencing severe otalgia, a sensation of ear blockage in the left ear, and hearing loss for the past few months. Previous attempts at ear wax removal at several ENT clinics have been unsuccessful, even after using alkaline ear drops. The patient has a history of a tympanoplasty and endoscopic sinus surgery with septoplasty 10 years ago.\n\nO: The patient is comfortable, afebrile, and has stable vital signs. An otoscopic examination revealed impacted ear wax covering the tympanic membrane in the left ear that could not be assessed. The right ear showed mild ear wax with an unremarkable tympanic membrane. Oropharyngeal examination was normal, cervical lymph nodes were not palpable, and cranial nerves were intact. Nasal endoscopy was also unremarkable. Blood tests were normal. Further examination under general anesthesia revealed a thick keratinous plug in the left ear, distending the external auditory canal, with bone remodeling. The tympanic membrane was intact.\n\nA: The diagnosis is keratosis obturans (KO), confirmed by the presence of a thick keratinous plug in the external auditory canal.\n\nP: The keratinous plug was removed, and an ear pack draped with antibiotics was placed to assist healing. The patient is advised to keep the ear pack clean and dry, avoid inserting anything into the ear, and attend a scheduled follow-up appointment to monitor healing. The patient should contact the clinic if there are any concerns or changes in symptoms.",
  "S: The patient reported dealing with a recurrent, itchy rash for about a year. The rash is diffuse and spread all over the body, particularly on the extremities and trunk, especially on the flanks. The rash consists of red, raised bumps with minimal scaling.\n\nO: A biopsy of the left part of the chest showed a predominantly perivascular inflammatory infiltrate with occasional eosinophils, consistent with Drug Hypersensitivity Reaction (DHR). The direct immunofluorescence test was negative. Previously tried treatments included topical triamcinolone, clobetasol, and hydroxyzine, which were ineffective. Oral prednisone helped but was discontinued due to steroid-induced diabetes. Dupilumab injections of 300 mg every 14 days resolved dermatitis and pruritus after 4 months. Due to medication costs, injections were spaced to every 30 days, with continued symptom resolution and no side effects.\n\nA: The rash is consistent with a Drug Hypersensitivity Reaction (DHR).\n\nP: Continue monitoring the patient's progress with dupilumab injections spaced every 30 days. Adjust the treatment plan as necessary, and instruct the patient to reach out if any changes occur or concerns arise.",
  "S: The patient is a 19-year-old male who presented with melena occurring once a day for the past week, accompanied by vomiting, shortness of breath, and palpitations. He has a history of two distinct episodes of epistaxis in childhood and a family history of increased bleeding tendency in his paternal grandmother. The patient has received fresh frozen plasma infusions in the past.\n\nO: Severe anemia was indicated by a hemoglobin level of 5.80 g/dL. Initial blood samples showed a strongly positive indirect Coomb's test and a negative direct Coomb's test. Extended antibody testing revealed pan-agglutination matched with anti-Kell, anti-Lub, and anti-Kpb antibodies. Cross-matching showed +4 incompatibility with all tested RBC units. After a transfusion of the least incompatible O negative RBCs, the patient experienced shivering, a temperature rise to 101\u00b0F, tachycardia, and hypotension. A transfusion reaction workup showed grade 4+ pan agglutination in serum.\n\nA: Severe anemia likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding (melena) complicated by multiple blood group alloantibodies causing transfusion reactions. Possible hereditary bleeding disorder given family history and past epistaxis.\n\nP: Administer intravenous antihistamine and hydrocortisone. Transferred the patient to ICU for further monitoring. Administered intranasal desmopressin and intravenous factor VIII. A transfusion reaction workup was performed, indicating continued monitoring and exploration of alternative treatment options for anemia management.",
  "S: The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, presenting with fatigue and constitutional syndrome lasting for 5 months. Previously, an extrainstitutional CT indicated multiple focal liver lesions with microcalcifications, interpreted as possible metastatic disease.\n\nO: Physical examination revealed no positive findings. Extraneutral paraclinical tests showed negative tumour markers and normal liver function tests. MRI findings showed a normally sized and morphologically normal liver with multiple focal lesions in all hepatic segments. The largest lesion, located in the right lobe, measured 5 cm. Lesions appeared hyperintense in T2 sequences and hypointense in T1 sequences, with no fatty component. Discrete heterogeneous peripheral enhancement was noted in some lesions after contrast administration, with little contrast uptake even in late sequences.\n\nA: Findings suggest lesions are not typical of metastatic disease, with differential diagnoses still being explored. Further monitoring and potentially additional tests will be necessary to characterize the hepatic lesions.\n\nP: Follow-up with healthcare team to manage lupus and monitor changes in symptoms. Additional tests may be conducted as necessary, based on ongoing assessment and monitoring of the hepatic lesions.",

Since then, he has experienced fear of contamination, leading to isolation and inability to work. He reports worsening depression, dysphoria, anxiety, anhedonia, low energy, low motivation, decreased social interest, and poor sleep. The patient's anxiety began at age 14 with trichotillomania and at age 15 he developed a fear of contamination; he typically managed these symptoms with compulsive hand washing. He has a history of outpatient psychiatric treatment and one prior psychiatric hospitalization. There is no history of hallucinations, delusions, mania, hypomania, drug abuse, suicidal, physically or sexually aggressive behavior. He grew up in Maryland, lives with his mother and stepfather, and works as an editorial assistant. He experienced early experimentation with his stepbrother in middle school but reports no history of physical or sexual abuse.\n\nO: No information provided.\n\nA: The patient is experiencing an exacerbation of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms following a nocturnal emission, leading to secondary depression and suicidal ideation. His history is significant for OCD starting in adolescence and a prior psychiatric hospitalization.\n\nP: The patient will be admitted to the emergency room for further assessment and treatment of his OCD and depression, as well as addressing suicidal thoughts. He will be provided with support and care, with the option for family involvement in his treatment.",
  "S: \nThe patient is a 59-year-old female working as a rehabilitation worker who reports gradually enlarging swellings under both the right and left scapula for about eight months. These swellings are more visible when she stretches her arms forward or elevates her upper extremities and feel soft to the touch. She experiences pain in her upper extremities and arms. The patient has no history of accidents or falls that could explain these symptoms. She has previously undergone neurosurgical procedures for disc extrusion in the cervical and thoracic spine. Bilateral swellings were present before her surgery, and the swelling on the right side recurred after previous treatment, which included repeated punctures and partial resection.\n\nO: \nMagnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic wall shows symmetrical fluid collections in the subscapular regions. On the right side, the dimensions are 120 \u00d7 37 \u00d7 115 mm with a volume of 250 ml; on the left side, 120 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 90 mm with a volume of 130 ml. The contents are moderately heterogeneous with sporadic internal septa, and the cystic formations have distinct signals. T1 weighting showed hypersensitive contents on the right side, indicating potential chronic post haemorrhagic changes. After contrast administration, there was no significant increase in signal intensity except for moderate reinforcement of the capsule on the left side. No diffusion restriction was observed. Axillary lymphatic nodes are of physiological size, pulmonary parenchyma is without changes, and no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy is present.\n\nA: \nThe patient's condition suggests symmetrical subscapular cystic formations with chronic post haemorrhagic changes on the right side. The differential includes benign cystic lesions but further evaluation is necessary to understand the nature and cause of persistent symptoms and fluid collections.\n\nP: \nSchedule a follow-up appointment to discuss treatment options and monitor the patient's condition. The patient is advised to report any changes in symptoms or new concerns. Further imaging or biopsy might be considered to assess the nature of the cystic formations.",

The patient also has a history of hypertension for 9 years and type 2 diabetes diagnosed a year ago. There are no prior malignant diseases or distant metastases reported.\n\nO: The physical examination revealed no palpable neck and supraclavicular lymph nodes. Blood count and biochemical analysis showed no significant abnormalities. An Iohexol swallowing test indicated a malignant-appearing structure in the inferior-thoracic region. Endoscopic assessment identified a lesion of mucosal hyperplasia forming a luminal stenosis, 36 cm from the incisor teeth, with difficulty passing the gastroscope. Biopsy confirmed an esophageal MEC. CT scan showed the tumor as resectable. Post-surgery, the esophagectomy specimen revealed a fungating tumor measuring 45 mm longitudinally and 40 mm cross-sectionally, with histopathology showing epidermoid cells, keratin pearl formation, columnar mucus-secreting cells, and intermediate cells with tube-like structures. The tumor was positive for p-63 and CK5/6.\n\nA: The patient is diagnosed with an esophageal MEC, with the tumor showing characteristics of epidermoid cells and the presence of keratin pearl formation. \n\nP: The patient is scheduled for an esophagectomy with 2-field lymphadenectomy and esophagogastrostomy. Post-surgery, the plan involves monitoring recovery, managing hypertension and diabetes, and advising smoking cessation and reduced alcohol consumption to improve overall health. Follow-up care will be provided as necessary.",
  "S: The patient, a woman in her late seventies, reports having an aortic aneurysm. She lives independently and can perform daily activities without assistance. In September 2019, she was admitted for elective embolization of a type 2 endoleak. Post-procedure, the patient experienced weakness and numbness in both lower limbs, more pronounced on the right side.\n\nO: Examination following the embolization revealed lower motor neuron pattern weakness in the bilateral lower limbs, with the right side more affected. Sensation was normal on the left but impaired on the right from L2 to S1. Reflexes were absent in both lower limbs. An urgent CT aortogram indicated post-interval embolization of bilateral feeding arteries with Onyx material in a branch of the embolized right iliolumbar artery extending into the spinal canal at L3 and exiting at L2. An MRI of the thoracolumbar spine was also performed. A lumbar spinal drain was inserted, and fluid replacement was initiated to maintain a mean arterial pressure above 80 mm Hg.\n\nA: The patient is experiencing symptoms possibly due to spinal cord ischemia following the embolization procedure.\n\nP: The patient will be carefully monitored with ongoing assessment and adjustments in her treatment.

  "S: The patient has been using artificial sweeteners for 14 years and was diagnosed with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism. Initially, the patient experienced significant weight gain of 20 lbs, which they correlated with the use of artificial sweeteners. The patient subsequently reduced and stopped using artificial sweeteners.\n\nO: Initial thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level was 12.2 mIU/L (above normal), free T4 was 0.5 ng/dl (below normal), and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (Anti TPO Ab) was 196 IU/ml (above normal). After treatment with levothyroxine 0.75 mg/day, TSH levels normalized between 1.23 mIU/L and 2.16 mIU/L. Stopping artificial sweeteners led to an unanticipated drop in TSH to 0.005 mIU/L. Discontinuation of levothyroxine resulted in normal TSH, Anti-TPO Ab, TSI, and TBII levels. The patient has remained clinically euthyroid without treatment.\n\nA: The patient was initially diagnosed with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism, but is now clinically euthyroid following the discontinuation of artificial sweeteners and levothyroxine. Other autoimmune disorders and drug-induced thyroiditis have been ruled out.\n\nP: The patient should continue monitoring thyroid levels and report any symptoms or changes to their healthcare provider. Regular follow-up is suggested to ensure continued euthyroid status.",
  "S: The patient was born at term by natural delivery with a birth weight of 3950 g, length of 51 cm, and occipital frontal circumference of 34.5 cm. The Apgar scores were 9/9. The patient began walking by 13 months and speaking first words at 11 months, with no developmental delays or intellectual disabilities, except for mild learning disabilities and dysgraphia identified at age 9. At age 13, the patient experienced symptoms such as obesity, hyperactivity, dysphagia, sleep disturbance, and minor dysmorphic features, including a round face, bushy eyebrows, and stubby hands. There is a reported similarity to Smith-Magenis syndrome, but without a molecular diagnosis. The patient\u2019s parental age at birth was 38 and 43, and they were healthy and unrelated. A prenatal NT ultrasound and karyotype on amniocytes were normal.\n\nO: At age 13, the patient presented with obesity, normal height, hyperactivity, dysphagia, sleep disturbances, and minor dysmorphic features. Neuroimaging showed an altered signal near the capsular lenticular structures and the head of the caudate nucleus, implying a hamartoma.\n\nA: The patient has a mild phenotype similar to Smith-Magenis syndrome, with features including dysgraphia, obesity, hyperactivity, dysphagia, sleep disturbance, and minor dysmorphic features. Despite phenotypic similarities, molecular testing did not confirm a diagnosis of Smith-Magenis syndrome.\n\nP: Continue regular follow-ups with healthcare providers to monitor growth, development, and any changes in condition. Maintain a healthy lifestyle to manage obesity and related symptoms.",
  "S: The patient reports diffuse abdominal pain and obstipation for the past 24 hours. There is no history of vomiting or fever. The patient has a surgical history of splenectomy 12 years ago due to a traumatic rupture of the spleen and no other medical issues.\n\nO: Vital signs are within normal limits, and the patient is afebrile. Physical examination reveals a distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness. Blood tests show a high white blood cell count of 23040/mm\u00b3, but hepatic and pancreatic enzymes are normal. CT scan shows multiple splenic nodules in the left upper quadrant, small bowel distention, and air-fluid levels in the jejunum, suggesting intestinal obstruction. Exploratory laparotomy reveals splenic nodules causing external compression and obstruction of the small bowel and colon.\n\nA: The patient has an intestinal obstruction due to splenosis, where splenic tissue has revascularized and caused compression of the bowel.\n\nP: Three splenic tissues that caused the obstruction were resected, and pathologic studies confirmed splenosis. The patient was discharged on the 7th post-operative day following recovery. The patient is advised to monitor for similar symptoms and return for evaluation if they arise.",
  "S: The patient is an 86-year-old female experiencing difficulty breathing, particularly during physical activity. She reports these symptoms to the doctor.\n\nO: The patient is described as frail and has an elevated brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of >900. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) reveals severe aortic stenosis (AS) with an aortic valve area of 0.58 cm\u00b2 and peak velocity of 4.0 m/s. There is diffuse left ventricular hypertrophy with Maron type III hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, LVOT obstruction with systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve, and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). During a Valsalva maneuver, peak velocity at the LVOT was 2.9 m/s, and the mean pressure gradient was 32 mmHg. After administering bisoprolol, the LVOT obstruction and SAM disappeared, and MR was reduced to mild. However, high peak velocity across the aortic valve and BNP level persisted.\n\nA: The assessment indicates severe aortic stenosis with complications including left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction and mitral valve involvement leading to moderate mitral regurgitation. There is also mention of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nP: The plan includes performing a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with a 23 mm SAPIEN 3 valve via transfemoral approach under general anesthesia and transesophageal echocardiography guidance, with continuous beta-blocker infusion and volume loading. Post-implantation, if SAM and MR reoccur with unstable hemodynamics, an emergent alcohol septal ablation (ASA) will be performed to stabilize the patient.",
  "S: The patient reports a recent 24-hour history of nausea and vomiting, followed by acute, moderate right-sided testicular pain. The patient did not experience any fever. Past medical history includes an isolated episode of transient neutropenia and hepatosplenomegaly as an infant, both of which resolved completely.

  "S: The patient was admitted to the cardiomyopathy clinic for repetitive ventricular ectopic beats. The patient reports no major issues today and denies experiencing syncope or having a family history of cardiomyopathy or sudden cardiac death. The patient had an episode of acute myocarditis a year ago, characterized by chest pain, troponin rise, and T wave inversion in the inferolateral leads on ECG. The coronary angiogram showed normal coronary arteries, and a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) indicated mid-wall myocardial edema and late gadolinium enhancement. The patient did not consent to an endomyocardial biopsy at that time. Recent follow-up revealed a mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with diffuse subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement on CMR.\n\nO: The patient appears hemodynamically stable. Previous echocardiography indicated an initial reduction of left ventricular ejection fraction with hypo-akinesia of the lateral wall, but preserved right ventricular dimensions and function. The recent CMR showed no myocardial edema but confirmed diffuse circumferential subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement. Genetic testing and family screening found the patient's mother and sister to have inverted T waves on ECG and mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction.\n\nA: The findings suggest a potential left-dominant variant of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy given the pattern of late gadolinium enhancement and family ECG abnormalities.\n\nP: Continue with close clinical follow-up and monitoring of the patient's cardiac health and familial conditions. Consider further tests as recommended by the medical team to investigate and manage the potential arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. Discuss findings and implications with family members to ensure comprehensive care and understanding of the condition.",

The pain is sharp, intermittent, seems to spread to the left upper back and left arm, and worsens with deep breaths. The patient also reports having a fever and chills. No recent tick bites, upper respiratory symptoms, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), orthopnea, arthralgias, or rashes.\n\nO: During the physical examination, vital signs were normal, heart sounds were normal without murmurs, rubs, or gallops, there was no jugular vein distention, chest wall tenderness, or pitting edema. Lungs were clear upon auscultation. Diagnostic tests revealed an elevated troponin T level peaking at 910ng/L (normal <22ng/L), right axis deviation with left posterior fascicular block, and premature atrial contractions in trigeminy on ECG, and a trace of pericardial effusion on ultrasound. CT angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism. Lyme serology, ANA, respiratory viral panel, and TSH were normal. Leukocytosis at 11.09 K/ul with an absolute neutrophil count of 8.09 K/uL, elevated ESR at 37mm/hr, and elevated CRP at 11.6mg/L.\n\nA: The clinical picture suggests myocardial inflammation potentially related to the recent vaccination, indicated by elevated troponin levels and pericardial effusion. The observed ECG findings could reflect underlying cardiac electrical changes.\n\nP: The patient should rest, stay hydrated, and monitor symptoms. If symptoms worsen or new symptoms arise, they should return to the emergency department or contact their primary care physician. Continuous monitoring of symptoms and inflammatory markers is advised to decide further testing or treatment as required.",
  "S: The patient is a 55-year-old female experiencing numbness of extremities for the past month, which has worsened recently. She was previously admitted to a hospital where an MRI revealed an intramedullary mass lesion in the medulla oblongata. She experienced intractable hiccoughs alongside worsening numbness. The patient refused biopsy or surgical removal of the mass due to high risk. She is concerned about her symptoms and the findings of her recent tests.\n\nO: Upon examination, there was marked deep sensory disturbance in the distal portions of the extremities. MRI showed a circumscribed mass in the medulla oblongata, appearing hyperintense on T2-weighted images, isointense on T1-WI, and enhanced with gadolinium-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid. Cerebrospinal fluid examination indicated slightly elevated protein levels and significant lymphocytosis with a CD4/CD8 ratio of 5.86. The ECG revealed a complete AV block. CT of neck and chest showed bilateral supraclavicular, hilar, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Pathological examination from transbranchial needle aspiration revealed a noncaseating granuloma consisting of epithelioid cells, lymphocytes, and rare multinucleated giant cells.\n\nA: The findings are consistent with sarcoidosis, causing the brainstem mass and other systemic symptoms. The complete AV block was addressed with permanent pacemaker insertion.\n\nP: The patient was started on oral prednisone therapy at 60 mg/day for 4 weeks. This led to the resolution of hiccoughs and numbness.

They have a medical history of adult Still's disease, diagnosed at age 49, and have been under treatment with oral prednisolone (90 mg/day) and cyclosporine (175 mg/day).\n\nO: The physical examination revealed deep tenderness in the abdomen. Test results showed slight leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9100/\u03bcL and an elevated C-reactive protein level of 9.3 mg/dL. A CT scan revealed extra-intestinal free air around the rectum and massive retroperitoneal emphysema. Postoperative findings included a hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL, a slight prolongation of prothrombin time, a left retroperitoneal hematoma, and extravasation from the left first lumbar arteries. A later CT scan showed intra-abdominal free air and a cecal perforation.\n\nA: The initial preoperative diagnosis was a rectal perforation. Postoperatively, the patient was diagnosed with a left retroperitoneal hematoma due to extravasation from the lumbar arteries, and later with a cecal perforation. There is no association with cytomegalovirus enteritis and diverticulum perforation based on pathological studies. The patient subsequently developed an intra-abdominal abscess and a surgical site infection.\n\nP: The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy to treat the initial rectal perforation, including pus aspiration, saline irrigation, and Hartmann's operation. Postoperative complications included a retroperitoneal hematoma, which required transarterial angiography and embolization. A second laparotomy was performed to address the cecal perforation, suspected to result from a diverticulum, leading to an ileostomy without intraperitoneal anastomosis. Ongoing monitoring and treatment are required for the intra-abdominal abscess and surgical site infection.",

  "S: The patient, a 21-year-old Somali woman, reported experiencing difficulty breathing and extreme swelling prior to an emergency caesarean section. This was her first pregnancy, delivered at 35 weeks due to acute dyspnea, placental abruption, gross edema, and severe preeclampsia/HELLP syndrome. \n\nO: The patient's soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1/placental growth factor ratio was 211.4, indicating a high pretest probability for TTP. Post-surgery, she was transferred to the ICU for lung edema. Lab results showed anemia (hemoglobin 7.4 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelets at 50 G/L), negative Coombs test, increased LDH (690 U/L), bilirubin (2.2 mg/dL), elevated AST (150 U/L) and ALT (140 U/L), creatinine (1.19 mg/dL), no detectable haptoglobin (< 0.09 g/L), and manifold schistocytes (2.8%) with extended prothrombin time (38.2 s). Systolic blood pressure was between 160 and 200 mmHg despite medication.\n\nA: The high PLASMIC score indicated a > 90% pretest probability for TTP. The patient's condition was severe, with critical lab findings and resistant high blood pressure.\n\nP: The plan included initiating plasma exchange therapy (PEX) and glucocorticoid medication, while continuing diagnostic evaluations. Despite treatment, renal parameters elevated (creatinine to 2.09 mg/dL, eGFR 33 mL/min/1.73m\u00b2), fibrinogen decreased to 103 mg/dL, and thrombocyte count remained low at 35 G/L. Further monitoring and adjustments to the treatment were planned. The patient was instructed to adhere to medication and attend follow-up appointments to ensure recovery.",
  "S: The patient initially reports right lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting that started that morning. The following day, the patient returns with severe pain in the right testicle.\n\nO: Abdominal exam initially appears normal. Abdominal ultrasound and CT scan results are unremarkable. A genital exam reveals indications of testicular torsion, leading to a decision for immediate surgical intervention. During surgery, a right orchiectomy is performed.\n\nA: Initial suspicion based on symptoms included appendicitis, but after consultations, appendicitis was ruled out. The eventual assessment reveals testicular torsion. In retrospect, it was acknowledged that a scrotal exam should have been included during the initial visit due to the correlation with isolated abdominal pain.\n\nP: Immediate surgical intervention was performed with a right orchiectomy. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled to monitor recovery and address concerns. The patient is advised to look out for signs of infection or unusual pain and return to the emergency department if necessary.",

  "S: The patient initially reported trouble breathing and a sensation of chest pressure. Eight months after initial treatment, they experienced tachycardia and dyspnea again.\n\nO: An initial echocardiography revealed an abundant pericardial effusion and a large intrapericardial mass causing cardiac tamponade. Surgery was performed to remove a 9.8 x 6.1 x 3.2 cm pericardial tumor. Histology identified it as a monophasic (spindle cell) synovial sarcoma with an SYT-SSX2 transcript. Postoperative imaging showed no residual tumor initially. Later tests revealed a recurrent pericardial tumor extensively involving both atria and left pulmonary veins. Subsequent imaging documented extensive tumor regrowth involving the heart, great vessels, left bronchus, esophagus, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\n\nA: The patient was diagnosed with cardiac tamponade secondary to a pericardial mass, which was identified as a monophasic synovial sarcoma. Despite initial tumor removal and chemotherapy, the sarcoma recurred and progressed, showing extensive involvement of surrounding structures.\n\nP: The initial plan involved surgery to remove the pericardial mass, followed by chemotherapy with epirubicin and ifosfamide for 6 cycles over 4 months. After the tumor recurred, further chemotherapy with cisplatinum and docetaxel was administered for 6 cycles over 4 months, followed by intensity-modulated radiotherapy for 54 Gy over 25 sessions in 2 months. However, after significant tumor regrowth with extensive involvement, no further treatment options were available. The focus shifted to discussing the situation and preferences with family and making necessary arrangements for end-of-life care.",

A follow-up plan involves monitoring for recurrence and performing salvage surgery if needed. At 23 months, a local recurrence occurred, and salvage surgery was conducted.",
  "S: The patient has been experiencing continuous pain and bleeding from the residual vagina. A past medical history includes a transurethral resection of a bladder tumor (TURBT) in 2004, diagnosed as high-grade urothelial carcinoma with adenocarcinomatous differentiation. Recently, an MRI detected a tumor in the residual vagina, and a biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma. The patient also underwent imaging tests (CT and bone scintigraphy) showing no metastasis at that time. The surgical resection of the tumor required partial resection of the sigmoid colon due to adherence. After surgery, local recurrence and pelvic bone metastasis were detected. Additionally, the patient developed ileus in January 2011, treated surgically, and has since developed multiple lung metastases and pelvic recurrence.\n\nO: Pathological examination revealed adenocarcinoma and SCC in the tumor. Immunohistochemistry was positive for SCC markers (CD56, chromogranin A, synaptophysin) and negative for urothelial carcinoma markers (GATA-3, p63, uroplakin, thrombomodulin, and 34\u03b2E12). Recurrence and metastasis were confirmed via MRI three months post-surgery.\n\nA: The patient has a recurring bladder tumor with adenocarcinoma and SCC features. There's a confirmed local recurrence in the pelvis and pelvic bone metastasis. Multiple lung metastases and further pelvic recurrence have developed since.\n\nP: The patient is undergoing radiation therapy to control tumor spread (52 Gy, 26 fractions). The plan includes continued monitoring and appropriate treatment management to address disease progression and symptoms.",
  "S: The patient is an 8-year-old neutered male miniature Poodle who was hit by a car 4 days ago. He was initially seen at a local emergency clinic, where spinal trauma was suspected, and a possible vertebral injury or intravertebral disc compression at T2-T3 was noted. Currently, he struggles with breathing, has difficulty moving, and experiences significant pain, especially when his neck is touched. \n\nO: The initial examination revealed tachypnea and lateral recumbency, with a body condition score of 5/9. Pain was noted at 2/4 on the Canine Acute Pain Scale. A neurologic exam showed the dog was laterally recumbent, quiet, and alert with intact cranial nerve function. He was nonambulatory with paresis of thoracic limbs and plegia of pelvic limbs, increased muscle tone in thoracic limbs, a right head turn, decreased conscious proprioception in thoracic limbs, and absent proprioception in pelvic limbs. Segmental reflexes remained intact, though the panniculus reflex was absent caudal to L1 bilaterally. Blood work indicated elevated alanine aminotransferase (185U/L), normochromic normocytic anemia (hematocrit 35.7%), leukocytosis (15.69K/uL), neutrophilia (10.7K/uL), and monocytosis (2K/uL).\n\nA: The diagnostic impressions suggest inflammation or infection with potential liver involvement due to elevated liver enzymes and anemia. Neurolocalization is determined to be T3-L3 with suspected C6-T2 involvement, indicative of trauma-related spinal injuries.\n\nP: The plan involves continuing medical management and close monitoring of the dog's condition. Further diagnostics, such as an MRI or CT scan, may be required to assess the extent of injuries. Consultation with a specialist is planned to optimize the treatment strategy. The owner should watch closely for any changes in the dog's condition and report them promptly.",

They had recurrent upper respiratory infections and stomatitis early in life. The patient was born after a full-term gestation, with a birth weight of 3,600 g. There is no significant family medical history.\n\nO: Physical examination showed splenomegaly with a long axis of 11.5 cm on ultrasound. Blood tests revealed profound neutropenia with an absolute neutrophil count of 0.02 \u00d7 10^9/L, with no anemia or thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow examination showed normal erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages, rare myeloid precursors, and below-normal growth of myeloid cells. The patient's bone marrow plasma inhibited the growth of progenitor cells from healthy donors. Anti-neutrophil IgG levels were 171.1 mg/dL.\n\nA: The findings suggest a misdiagnosed form of autoimmune neutropenia. Differential diagnoses such as Kostmann disease, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, Fanconi anemia, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria were excluded.\n\nP: Continue to explore treatment options for autoimmune neutropenia and closely monitor the patient's condition. Maintain communication with the healthcare team to develop a tailored treatment plan. The patient is advised to report any new symptoms or concerns.",
  "S: The patient reports a history of spine surgery 15 years ago for a right L4-L5 disc herniation. Initially, there was relief, but pain returned after three years. The patient underwent several treatments at a pain clinic, including intra-foraminal L4-L5 and L5-S1 corticosteroid injections and percutaneous radiofrequency denervation over 10 years. In June 2014, the patient experienced severe bilateral L5 sciatalgy with paresthesias and mictional delay but no motor dysfunction.\n\nO: An MRI in July 2014 revealed a disc herniation originating from the L4-L5 disc, perforating the common longitudinal ligament and anterior dura, entering the thecal sac, and extending to the upper sacrum. The intradural herniation is large, with rootlets surrounding the disc fragment. The upper disc fragment shows compact characteristics typical of extradural herniations with some peripheral contrast enhancement. The intradural part appears crumbled with irregular borders and no contrast enhancement. Surgery involved hemilaminectomy on L4 and L5 with adjacent hemiflavectomy at L3/4 and L5/S1.\n\nA: The patient had a recurrent L4-L5 disc herniation with intradural extension, causing severe bilateral sciatalgy and mictional delay. Post-surgical intervention was warranted due to the severity and complexity of the condition.\n\nP: The patient should follow post-operative care instructions from the surgeon, attend all follow-up appointments, and promptly report any changes in symptoms. Rehabilitation and physical therapy may be recommended to aid recovery and improve strength and mobility.",

Continue current medication regimen, with adjustments for perioperative care as noted. No further information on follow-up provided.",
  "S: The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease, undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (PD) for 3 years. He presents with cloudy dialysate and diffuse abdominal pain for the past 2 hours. He recently completed a 10-day course of moxifloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia but reports his cough hasn't improved and remains severe. Two days ago, he visited the emergency department with epigastric pain and intractable cough, but without nausea, vomiting, or fever. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a distended gallbladder with sludge, and he was discharged with antitussives and analgesics.\n\nO: Vital signs: Temperature 36 \u00b0C, heart rate 104 bpm, respiratory rate 19 bpm, blood pressure 121/91 mmHg. Physical examination indicates diffuse abdominal tenderness with peritoneal irritation, and a clean exit site for the PD catheter. Prior labs showed WBC count of 12,000 cells/mm\u00b3 (87% neutrophils), hemoglobin 8.0 g/dL, and other routine blood tests. PD dialysate effluent analysis initially had WBC 2/\u03bcL without PMN and later WBC 1783/\u03bcL including 50% PMN. Chest radiography showed no signs of pneumonia. Follow-up dialysate analysis on day 2 showed WBC 1565/\u03bcL (PMN 71%).\n\nA: The patient is diagnosed with PD peritonitis as indicated by the increased WBC count and PMN percentage in the PD dialysate effluent analysis. Persistent cough is likely contributing to abdominal strain.\n\nP: The patient is admitted to the ward for treatment of PD peritonitis. He will receive intraperitoneal Cefuroxime and amikacin as empirical treatment. Daily monitoring of PD dialysate effluent will be conducted to assess response and adjust treatment accordingly.",
  "S: The patient, a 43-year-old woman, reports severe dysphonia related to scarred vocal folds following phonosurgery. She has a history of thyroidectomy for goiter and hysterectomy for endometriosis. Five years ago, she had two laryngeal surgeries: suspension laryngoscopy for resection of Reinke edema and a right ventricular lesion biopsy, followed by cervicotomy with lateral thyrotomy, resulting in a chondroma diagnosis. Subsequently, another suspension laryngoscopy for granuloma excision on the left vocal fold was performed without recurrence of laryngeal pathologies. Despite regular speech therapy, she has persistent dysphonia, which presents as a hoarse, unstable, and slightly breathy voice with difficulty reaching high notes.\n\nO: Videolaryngostroboscopy showed a scarred appearance of the vocal folds with absence of vibration in the middle third. Vocal assessment confirmed dysphonia characterized by a hoarse, unstable, and slightly breathy voice.\n\nA: The clinical impression is severe dysphonia due to scarred vocal folds post-phonosurgery.\n\nP: The patient is eligible for a phase I clinical trial involving a local injection of autologous adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (ADSVF) to improve vocal fold flexibility and vibration. The injection will be scheduled shortly. The patient is advised to continue speech therapy and will be closely monitored throughout the trial.",

  "S: The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of osteopenia and gallstones. Her family history includes colon cancer and Gaucher disease (GD) with three successive generations being affected. Her son and father had colon cancer and GD in their 30s, presenting with easy bruising, thrombocytopenia, and splenomegaly. The patient herself had colon cancer in her 50s, successfully resected, with pathology showing Gaucher cells. She is currently asymptomatic, experiencing no bone pain, fractures, bruising, bleeding, fatigue, or weight loss. The family has been tested for familial colon cancer, with results being noncontributory for Lynch syndrome.\n\nO: The patient's pulse rate during examination was regular but low at 42 beats per minute. There was no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly or purpura. Mild cervical dystonia with neck ratcheting to the left was observed. The complete blood count was within normal limits. \u03b2-glucosidase activity was reduced at 2 nmol/h/mg (normal range is 8\u201316). Gene analysis detected a homozygous pathogenic variant in the GBA gene (N370S/N370S), confirming GD. Elevated biomarker levels were found: ACE at 66 U/L (normal range 9\u201363), chitotriosidase at 1603 nmoles/h/ml (normal range 4\u2013120), and glucosylsphingosine at 164 ng/mL (normal range <10 ng/mL).\n\nA: The patient has Gaucher disease (GD) confirmed by genetic analysis and elevated lipid storage biomarkers. The low pulse rate and cervical dystonia are noted but may not be related directly to GD.\n\nP: Plan includes monitoring the patient's condition and discussing potential treatment options for Gaucher disease. Regular follow-up appointments should be scheduled to manage and evaluate her symptoms and response to any initiated therapy.",
  "S: The patient reports having a history of asthma and skin cancer. There has been no recent trauma. The patient refused an enhanced CT scan due to concerns about the side effects of the contrast agent given their asthma.\n\nO: Initial chest X-ray showed abnormal shadows. Blood tests including haematology, renal, and hepatic function were normal. Electrocardiograms revealed no abnormalities. A chest CT found a well-defined, homogeneous tumour (66 X 65 X 45 mm) behind the trachea with 45 Hounsfield units but no calcification or fat. MRI showed a high signal on T2W1 images, indicating a cystic tumour. During surgery, the tumour appeared dark purple-red and saccular, connected to the azygos vein and adhered to the superior vena cava.\n\nA: The differential diagnosis included bronchogenic cyst, neurogenic tumour, Castleman disease, and malignant lymphoma. The final diagnosis was a bronchogenic cyst.\n\nP: The patient underwent cyst excision. Post-operatively, liver function was monitored for 6 days, leading to discharge. The patient is currently in good health and has been well for 4 years post-surgery. Future health monitoring is advised.",
  "S: The owner of an 8-year-old female spayed Dachshund reports a large, firm, symmetrical, painful perineal protrusion that appeared suddenly 2 days ago. The dog has a one-month history of dysuria and pollakiuria, initially thought to be due to a urinary tract infection treated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. However, after lack of response, a urine culture identified a Staphylococcus organism, and treatment was changed to marbofloxacin. The owner also reports the onset of tenesmus 2 days ago coinciding with the protrusion's appearance. The dog was spayed 2 years ago after multiple unsuccessful breeding attempts.\n\nO: Physical examination reveals a 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2 cm firm, painful protrusion in the perineal region, ventral to the anus. A digital rectal exam shows a fluid-filled structure ventral to the rectum and distal colon, with no pelvic diaphragm weakness. CT and vaginoscopy reveal a large, tubular, fluid-filled structure 4 cm in diameter and 16.3 cm long occupying the pelvic canal and caudal abdomen, compressing the colon and rectum dorsally and the urethra ventrally, and displacing the bladder to the left of the midline. Mild dilation of both renal pelves and proximal ureters is also noted.\n\nA: The diagnostic impressions include a large fluid-filled structure in the pelvic canal and caudal abdomen resulting in significant compression and displacement of abdominal organs. Mild dilation of renal pelves and proximal ureters suggests possible secondary pyelonephritis or backpressure effects. Perineal hernia is considered unlikely due to lack of pelvic diaphragm weakness.\n\nP: The plan includes consulting with colleagues to determine the best course of treatment, which may involve surgical or medical interventions. Further evaluation and close monitoring of the dog's condition are recommended. Owner is instructed to observe the dog closely and to contact the veterinary team if the condition worsens.",
  "S: The patient reported right hip and low back pain with radiation to the posterior right thigh. They have not experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in the legs. The patient initially obtained adequate pain relief from two right-sided SI joint injections before deciding to undergo surgical intervention.\n\nO: Provocative testing on the right SI joint showed reproducible pain. A radiographic spine survey did not reveal any structural source of low back pain or radiculopathy. Preoperative imaging, including MRI, showed lumbarization of the S1 vertebra, mammillary bodies in the alar region, and a residual S1-S2 disc.\n\nA: The diagnostic impression is consistent with SI joint dysfunction, warranting surgical intervention due to inadequate long-term relief from injections and the structural findings on imaging.\n\nP: The patient underwent SI joint fusion using the iFuse implant System\u00ae. During surgery, conducted under general anesthesia with the patient in the prone position, there was a brief bleed controlled by implant placement, and the procedure was completed successfully. Ongoing monitoring of recovery and follow-up care is planned.",
  "S: The patient was admitted on October 28th, 2016, with symptoms of abdominal pain, distension, dark urine, cough, expectoration, chills, and fever.

  "S: The patient, a long-term sufferer since age 2, reports persistent issues with food allergies to eggs and peanuts, accompanied by severe eczematous skin lesions resistant to local and systemic steroids. The patient experiences repeated sinopulmonary infections, recurrent infections with molluscum contagiosum, and flat warts on the face, neck, behind the ears, axillary area, and genitalia. Dental problems include malocclusion and retention of primary teeth, requiring dental intervention, and mucocutaneous candidiasis. The patient had a slowly growing right jaw mass at age 9, accompanied by toothache, treated with antibiotics but with no significant reduction in mass size. There were no symptoms of fever, headache, or bone pain. Itchy skin lesions appeared on the face, scalp, body, and genitalia. No history of jaundice, fever, caf\u00e9 au lait spots, or edema is reported. Parents are first cousins from both maternal and paternal sides.\n\nO: On examination, a non-tender right jaw swelling and a 2.5 cm right submandibular lymph node were observed, along with bilateral cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy measuring 1.5-2 cm. Oral examination revealed a bad-smelling, fungating mass related to the right mandible. Scattered crepitation and a palpable liver were noted in the chest and abdominal examination. The patient\u2019s growth parameters are below the 3rd centile. Vaccinations were administered according to the schedule in Iraq.\n\nA: The patient presents with persistent and complex symptoms suggestive of a possible immunodeficiency disorder, given the history of recurrent infections and poor response to standard treatments. Dental and growth abnormalities, along with familial consanguinity, may indicate an underlying genetic condition. The increasing jaw mass and associated lymphadenopathy raise concerns that require further investigation.\n\nP: Further diagnostic evaluation is recommended, potentially including genetic testing to identify any inherited disorders. Imaging studies (e.g., CT or MRI) and biopsy of the jaw mass may be necessary to determine its nature. Continued management of skin lesions and infections with appropriate medications and dermatological consultation is advised. Nutritional support and monitoring of growth parameters should be undertaken. Referral to an immunologist for comprehensive evaluation and management of suspected immunodeficiency is also recommended. Regular follow-up appointments should be scheduled to monitor progress and response to treatment.",

The patient is informed and fit for surgery, and all procedures will be communicated to him throughout the process.\n```",
  "S: The patient reports experiencing chest tightness, especially during physical activity, for the past month. This symptom prompted a previous hospital visit where an electrocardiogram showed ST-segment depression, leading to a suspicion of angina pectoris and a referral for further evaluation.\n\nO: An ECG indicated ST-segment depression in leads I, aVL, and V2-4. Laboratory tests on admission showed normal creatinine kinase and troponin I levels. Echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular contraction and mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. Coronary angiography demonstrated severe stenosis in the ostium of the left main trunk and right coronary artery, with % diameter stenosis of 95.0% and 87.2% respectively. Intra-coronary isosorbide dinitrate did not alleviate the stenosis, indicating an organic lesion. A contrast-enhanced CT scan showed no specific abnormalities of the aorta. Right and left ankle-brachial indices were 1.08 and 1.03, respectively. There was no significant carotid artery stenosis and no evidence of coronary risk factors, infectious disease, or congenital heart disease. Inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, were within normal range. Ophthalmologic examination found no vision impairment.\n\nA: The patient is diagnosed with coronary artery disease characterized by severe stenosis in the left main trunk and right coronary artery. The absence of response to intra-coronary isosorbide dinitrate indicates organic coronary stenosis.\n\nP: The patient has been started on optimal medical treatment, including a beta-blocker, an antiplatelet agent, and a statin for coronary artery disease. There is a plan for regular follow-up appointments to closely monitor the patient's symptoms and assess treatment efficacy.",
  "S: The patient was previously admitted to another hospital with cirrhosis and experienced hematemesis due to the rupture of esophageal varices. He underwent endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) to stop the bleeding but continued to experience hematemesis, with four more episodes following treatment. Multiple EVLs were performed, and transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) procedures to close an intra-arterial portal fistula (IAPF) were attempted without complete success. The patient was transferred for further treatment.\n\nO: Abdominal ultrasonography revealed ascites, and color Doppler ultrasonography identified an intra-arterial portal fistula (IAPF) between the left hepatic artery and the left branch of the portal vein with altered blood flow patterns. Contrast-enhanced CT and digital subtraction angiography confirmed the IAPF and early portal vein filling. Laboratory results indicated a white blood cell count of 4500/\u03bcL (normal), a low red blood cell count of 328 \u00d7 10^4/\u03bcL (normal: 427-570 \u00d7 10^4/\u03bcL), serum hemoglobin concentration of 10.2 g/dL (normal: 14-18 g/dL), a low platelet count of 12.8 \u00d7 10^4/\u03bcL (normal: 15-35 \u00d7 10^4/\u03bcL), and an elevated aspartate transaminase concentration of 69 IU.\n\nA: The patient is experiencing portal hypertension due to an intra-arterial portal fistula (IAPF), recurrent hematemesis from esophageal variceal ruptures, and liver inflammation. Anemia is also present, likely due to cirrhosis and repeated bleeding.\n\nP: The plan includes close monitoring of the patient's condition, further evaluation and management of the portal hypertension, consideration of additional interventions to control bleeding, and addressing the anemia. Further treatment plans will be developed to manage the blood flow abnormalities in the liver and prevent recurrent bleeding.",

He has some distinct physical features such as hypertelorism, narrow palpebral fissures, epicanthus, low-set ears, auricular malformation, and a transverse palmar crease on his right hand. His neuro-psycho-motor development is normal. He also experienced neonatal jaundice with peak bilirubin levels but no liver disease was noted.\n\nO: During the last physical examination, the patient weighed 16.6 kg and was 103 cm tall. Laboratory investigations indicated low plasma cortisol and ACTH concentrations, lack of circadian rhythm for ACTH and cortisol, and an ACTH test failed to stimulate cortisol production. Thyroid, kidney function, and electrolytes were normal, except for TSH anomalies. Continuous glucose monitoring shows normal blood sugar under non-stress conditions with a range of 4.7 \u00b1 0.\n\nA: The patient may have a disorder related to cortisol deficiency, possibly congenital adrenal hyperplasia or another form of adrenal insufficiency, given the low ACTH and cortisol levels and lack of response to ACTH stimulation. The hypoglycemia could be related to adrenal insufficiency.\n\nP: Continue close monitoring of blood glucose levels, particularly under stress conditions. Evaluate and manage any episodes of hypoglycemia promptly. Consider endocrinology referral for further evaluation and possibly starting on glucocorticoid therapy. Ensure regular follow-up to monitor growth and development and adjust treatment as necessary. Keep vigilant for changes in symptoms and report to healthcare providers.",
  "S: The patient reports experiencing vomiting for a few weeks, with symptoms increasing in frequency recently. They have been referred to the hospital for evaluation.\n\nO: An endoscopic upper gastrointestinal imaging showed a type 3 tumor at the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) with a circumference of 56 mm and associated stenosis. The epicenter of the tumor is 3 mm from the EGJ on the gastric side. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed lymph node metastases along the lesser curvature of the stomach and the proximal splenic artery.\n\nA: The patient has been diagnosed with a cT4aN2M0, cStage IIIC lesion according to the Union for International Cancer Control's TNM classification. The cancer is locally advanced with lymph node involvement but no distant metastasis.\n\nP: The next steps involve discussing the patient's case with a multidisciplinary team to determine the best treatment plan. Potential treatments may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these. The medical team will closely monitor the patient's progress and make adjustments to the treatment as needed. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to ensure ongoing care and support.",
  "S: The patient reports a persistent cough that has not resolved over time. They have a medical history of a hysterectomy 13 years ago for uterine leiomyoma.\n\nO: Chest radiography and CT scan showed multiple pulmonary bilateral nodules with no FDG uptake in the PET scan. A CT-guided biopsy of a pulmonary nodule and review of the resected uterine leiomyoma revealed identical histopathology indicating a low-grade, benign-appearing smooth muscle tumor, diagnosed as Benign Metastasizing Leiomyoma (BML). The immunohistochemical profile showed positivity for SMA, desmin, estrogen, and progesterone receptors, and negativity for HMB-45, CD31, CD34, and EMA. The ki-67 staining showed low mitotic activity. Cytogenetic analysis showed shared 19q and 22q terminal deletions. \n\nA: The clinical findings suggest Benign Metastasizing Leiomyoma (BML) with a stable follow-up post-surgical intervention.\n\nP: Surgical castration was performed, and after 6 months of follow-up, the lesions remained stable. Continued monitoring and follow-up are implied for managing the condition.",
  "S: Andrea reports intermittent left knee pain that occurs less than once a day, primarily when walking. She describes the knee as \"giving out\" suddenly but denies any pain or history of injury. The knee pain does not significantly interfere with daily activities, but Andrea plans to avoid certain activities like line dancing. Her blood pressure is usually around 120/70, and she takes her medications regularly. She also notes her fasting blood sugar runs higher at around 130, despite no late-night eating. She is currently on Farxiga, Amlodipine, Lisinopril, Hydrochlorothiazide, and Metformin.\n\nO: Vital signs: Temperature 98.2\u00b0F, Pulse 72, Respirations 16, Blood Pressure 122/70. Heart exam reveals a slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left base. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Right knee exam shows no ecchymosis, edema, or effusion, and she has a full range of motion without pain. X-ray of the left knee shows no fracture or bony abnormalities. \n\nA: Intermittent left knee weakness likely due to arthritis. Hypertension is well-controlled. Elevated fasting blood sugar suggesting suboptimal diabetes control. Heart murmur detected, requiring further evaluation.\n\nP: Start Meloxicam 15 mg daily for left knee arthritis. Consider physical therapy to strengthen knee muscles. Continue Lisinopril 20 mg for hypertension. Schedule an echocardiogram to evaluate the heart murmur. Order a hemoglobin A1c and lipid panel to assess diabetes control and cardiovascular risk.",
  "S: The patient is an 11-year-old girl with a thin build and presents with pain in the upper abdomen and recurrent vomiting for one week. She has a history of decreased appetite and disturbed behavior for the past few months. Her sibling has observed her chewing on her hair.\n\nO: The physical examination reveals a nontender lump in the epigastric region that moves with respiration. Laboratory tests indicate microcytic hypochromic anemia, with other parameters being normal. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE) shows a large blackish mass in the stomach, with a sample composed mostly of hairs.\n\nA: The diagnosis is trichobezoar, caused by the ingestion of hair which has formed a large mass in the stomach extending into the duodenum.\n\nP: The plan involves performing an anterior gastrotomy to surgically remove the hairball. Postoperatively, the period is expected to be uneventful, and a psychiatric consultation will be arranged to address the hair-chewing behavior. The patient will be discharged after surgery and psychiatric consultation, with a follow-up appointment scheduled in 6 months.",
  "S: The patient was involved in a motor vehicle collision and initially admitted to the Emergency Medicine Department. Upon arrival, they were fully oriented with a GCS of 15 and had mild cervical pain. They reported normal vital signs with no focal neurological deficits, and diagnostic tests (Brain CT scan, cervical and chest radiography, FAST examination) were unremarkable. The patient experienced sudden left hemiplegia two days later, leading to readmission. \n\nO: Diagnostic studies included Doppler sonography, which suggested a possible dissection or thrombosis of the right vertebral artery, and CT angiography confirmed the occlusion. The patient was admitted to the neurology ward, where treatment included titrated heparin infusions maintaining a PTT range of 50-70 seconds, and warfarin to achieve a target INR of 2-3. Atorvastatin 40 mg was also administered due to dyslipidemia. Physiotherapy was initiated and the patient recovered muscle strength (5/5) in four days.\n\nA: The patient\u2019s left hemiplegia was due to the occlusion of the right vertebral artery, likely from dissection or thrombosis. Dyslipidemia was also noted as a condition being managed.\n\nP: The patient was discharged with recovery in muscle strength and continued on warfarin therapy. They were advised to persist with atorvastatin due to dyslipidemia. The physiotherapy initiated was effective, and the patient expressed understanding and agreement with the treatment plan. Follow-up is indicated to monitor the patient\u2019s progress and response to medications.",
  "S: The patient reports having had vision problems since childhood, specifically nyctalopia, with worsening visual acuity and visual fields since their twenties. There is no family history of retinal disease.\n\nO: Visual acuity test results show 20/400 in the right eye and 20/63 in the left eye. Funduscopy reveals bone spicule pigmentation and attenuated retinal vessels. Fundus AF displays areas of increased and decreased autofluorescence in the right eye and a radial line pattern from the fovea in the left eye. OCT imaging shows widespread thinning of the photoreceptor layer with foveal sparing in the left eye, and thickening of the inner retina, particularly around the optic disc, more in the right eye. The genetic analysis confirms a de novo mutation in the patient\u2019s RPGR gene.\n\nA: The patient is diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa associated with a de novo RPGR gene mutation, resulting in progressive vision deterioration.\n\nP: The plan includes regular monitoring of the condition and managing symptoms. A referral to a low vision specialist is provided to help the patient adapt to decreasing vision.",
  "S: The patient reports experiencing bilateral visual impairment for about a year and progressively worsening general fatigue for the past three months. There is no history of epileptic seizures.\n\nO: Neurological examination reveals blindness in the left eye and half-blindness in the right eye on the ear side, along with some cognitive dysfunction. The patient's Mini Mental State Examination score is 21 out of 30. A fundus examination shows no papilledema. MRI results indicate a large tumor (77 \u00d7 63 \u00d7 85 mm) originating from the pituitary gland, compressing the optic chiasm and affecting the bilateral frontal and temporal lobes. Hormone profile indicates hyperprolactinemia (25,270.0 ng/ml) and dysfunction in other pituitary hormones.\n\nA: The patient is diagnosed with a giant prolactinoma (PRLoma) and hypopituitarism.\n\nP: The plan includes starting the patient on 1000 mg/day of levetiracetam to prevent potential seizures. Dopamine agonists (DA) will be initiated to treat the prolactinoma and manage hormone levels.",
  "S: The patient was involved in a tractor rollover crash, sustaining multiple fractures including left 1st to 12th ribs, right 1st to 6th ribs, left clavicle, a displaced T12 spinous process fracture, L1 burst fracture, and L2, 3, and 5 transverse process fractures. The patient reports severe pain in the thorax and back, with a slight improvement from 10/10 to 8/10 after treatment.\n\nO: Multimodal analgesia is being administered including acetaminophen 1000 mg 4 times daily, gabapentin 300 mg 3 times daily, hydromorphone PCA with an average 24-hour consumption of 4.7 mg/day, and lidocaine patches. An epidural is contraindicated due to traumatic spine fractures. A 48-hour continuous ketamine infusion was given at 10 mg/hr. The patient is on HFNC and intermittent CPAP. On postinjury day 3, the patient underwent surgical repair of the L1 burst fracture with T11-L3 posterior spinal instrumentation. Bilateral ESP catheters were placed intraoperatively for pain management. A right-sided ESP block was performed using ultrasound guidance targeting the right T5 transverse process.\n\nA: The patient has multiple rib, clavicle, and spinal fractures with associated severe pain. Slight pain improvement noted with current analgesic regimen. Epidural is contraindicated. High risk for surgical-site bleeding and epidural hematoma precluded intraoperative epidural placement.\n\nP: Continue multimodal analgesia and monitor pain levels. Maintain HFNC and CPAP as needed for respiratory support. Post-surgical placement of ESP catheters to aid in pain management should be monitored for effectiveness. Adjust pain management strategies as necessary. Regular follow-up to monitor progress and address any concerns or changes in pain levels.\n",
  "S: The patient has experienced low backache for one year and presents with typical claudication symptoms, left-sided numbness, and paresthesia of the foot, but no radicular pain. There has been a progressive reduction in claudication distance and a sudden worsening of gait, along with urinary incontinence following a trivial fall last week.\n\nO: Examination reveals bilateral high-stepping gait due to foot drop, symmetrical weakness of L4 and L5 roots (MRC grade 0/5), partial weakness of the S1 root (MRC grade 3/5), nondermatomal sensory disturbances, and absent deep tendon reflexes in lower limbs. Anal tone is normal, but saddle anesthesia is present. Postvoidal ultrasonogram shows a residual urine volume of 250 ml, indicating a neurogenic bladder. Plain radiography of the lumbar spine was inconclusive. MRI reveals a solitary intraspinal posterior epidural lesion at L2-L3, and adjacent epidural fatty hypertrophy causing severe canal stenosis. CT shows an osseous lesion on the right L2 inferior articular process causing severe canal stenosis.\n\nA: The findings suggest severe canal stenosis with significant compression of the cauda equina due to an osseous lesion causing neurological deficits. \n\nP: The recommendation is for surgical decompression and excision biopsy of the lesion to relieve severe canal stenosis at the earliest opportunity. The procedure involves positioning the patient prone on a Relton Hall frame, using a standard midline posterior approach to expose the L2 and L3 lamina, removal of the spinous process, followed by surgical decompression and excision biopsy.",
  "S: The patient is a 2.3-year-old boy from a South American ethnic background under the care of a public social institution. He has a history of microcephalus, complex febrile seizures, and moderate developmental delay. There is a history of prenatal exposure to ethanol.\n\nO: MRI shows hyperintense lesions in both \"corona radiata,\" more pronounced on the right side. EEG studies reveal abnormal activity with a generalized slow pattern and theta and delta bursts bilaterally in temporal regions during both sleep and wake states. Spectroscopy indicates immaturity in the frontal lobe, parietal areas, and basal nuclei. Genetic testing found a deletion of 183 bases in the EN2 gene, but no alterations in genes LIS1, PTAFR, PAFAH1B2, PAFAH1B3, FGF8, and PAX2.\n\nA: The patient has microcephalus with complex febrile seizures and developmental delay. Abnormal EEG findings suggest generalized brain dysfunction. MRI and spectroscopy findings indicate structural and developmental abnormalities. Genetic testing shows an EN2 gene deletion, possibly contributing to symptoms.\n\nP: The patient is being treated with valproic acid to manage seizures and improve his condition, showing an adequate physiological and clinical response. Continued monitoring of his progress and adjustments to treatment will be conducted as necessary. The guardian is advised to stay in contact with healthcare providers for updates and any concerns.",
  "\nS: The patient, a 42-year-old married woman with two children, reports experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms for the past 4 months, including heartburn after eating, frequent regurgitations, fatigue, and a change in bowel movements, characterized by 4-5 soft stools per day. She has lost about 3 kg in the past month despite normal or increased food intake. There is a family history of coeliac disease, as her older sister was diagnosed at age 20.\n\nO: Biochemical investigations showed normal IgA levels, negativity for anti-tTG and Ema antibodies, and normal haemoglobin, white blood cells, and platelet count. Ferritin level was 33 mg/l and serum folate was lower than 5 nmol/l. Stool parasitological and cultural analysis was negative for parasites and ova. Upper GI endoscopy revealed no macroscopic alterations, but biopsies indicated Helicobacter Pylori pan-gastritis and duodenal mucosa showed villous atrophy with increased intraepithelial T lymphocytes (over 40 IEL/100 EC).\n\nA: The patient presents with symptoms and biopsy findings consistent with Helicobacter Pylori gastritis and coeliac disease.\n\nP: Treatment will be discussed to address the Helicobacter Pylori infection and manage symptoms related to coeliac disease. Further dietary and lifestyle recommendations may be provided, and patient education regarding gluten-free diet adherence might be considered if coeliac disease is confirmed. Follow-up appointments to monitor progress and response to treatment will be scheduled.",
  "S: The patient presents with a lump in her left breast that she has noticed increasing over 14 months. She denies any personal history of cancer.\n\nO: Physical examination reveals a large, fixed 10 cm mass in the left breast, adherent to the chest but not invading the skin. There is no ulceration, nipple discharge, or retraction, and no palpable lymph nodes. A CT scan shows a well-defined round heterogeneous soft tissue density with necrosis and calcifications, measuring 07 cm \u00d7 10 cm \u00d7 11 cm, involving the intercostal muscles but not the lung. A core-needle biopsy indicates the mass is a Grade II chondrosarcoma.\n\nA: The initial clinical suspicion of a breast sarcoma was confirmed by biopsy results showing Grade II chondrosarcoma.\n\nP: The plan included performing a wide excision surgery to remove the tumor, involving the removal of the 4th, 5th, and 6th ribs with reconstruction using a polypropylene plate and latissimus dorsi muscle flap. After surgery, the patient would be extubated the next day and discharged in 10 days if no complications arise. Post-operative instructions and follow-up care were provided."
